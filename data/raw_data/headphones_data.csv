Overall it is a good buy for my outdoor runs.; UPDATE 31MARCH2025: (This post will help people as I see many reporting issues with connectivity/distortion/quality. )The issue as I see is with Samsung Android devices and not with other phones like nothing 2a as a family member has that and this headphone works fine there. Nevertheless, if you experience distortion or quality issues, you can try changing the bluetooth codec as mentioned below.Samsung has its own codec too which it uses for its earbuds.UPDATE 30MARCH2025: (This post will help people as I see many reporting issues with connectivity/distortion/quality. )Mostly as I saw the reviews - issues reported were with distorted sound/quality of sound and with a set of devices and mostly people saying that it was seen with windows pc. I was able to fix the problem myself. PLEASE NOTE: There was no help from Noise. Noise tech did not help troubleshoot.).My ticket was just closed from Noise end and so I realised if I went back there again,  the device would just  go back and forth only but my problem would not get fixed. No one from Noise called me through the entire process to even understand the issue in detail or even when it was marked checked after sending it back for the first time.----TECHNICAL EXPLANATION---How I solved the issue - A common problem reported from multiple reviews was about distortion(sometimes written as quality) and was with some devices and then mostly with windows pc users. So, it cannot be that such a priced headphone will have substandard quality when some verified purchases reviews having 5 stars. The battery is good. So, some issue might be with the chipset hardware.""Codec"" is coding-decoding and a bluetooth codec is used to compress and decompress audio data for efficient wireless transmission. Depending upon the codec the quality of your sound differs.This device seems to be defaulting to AAC (advcd audio encoding) which apple devices use. I had to go to ""Developer Options"" in android (to enable ""Developer Options"" in Android please google it) and try another codec. I switched to SBC (Sub-Band Codec) on my phone which is a very old codec and is prone to losses, and then it sounded fine. Attached two images for reference.for Samsung:1 Go to ""Settings""2 Tap ""About device"" or ""About phone""3 Tap “Software information”4 Tap “Build number” seven times. ...5 Enter your pattern, PIN or password to enable the Developer options menu.6 The ""Developer options"" menu will now appear in your Settings menu.PLEASE NOTE: YOUR PHONE NEEDS TO BE CONNECTED/PAIRED WITH THE HEADSET FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE BLUETOOTH CODEC OPTION IN YOUR ""DEVELOPER OPTIONS"" IN ANDROID. IF YOU ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE HEADSET, THE OPTION FOR CODEC SELECTION WILL BE GRAYED OUT.But upon shutting down and turning back on after few hours, when it pairs again, the setting goes back to AAC at times. Its a pain changing it again when you disconnect and reconnect back.On PC its completely distorted. Windows does not allow to change codecs. Based on what I found, it does not have selections like we have for Android. I will keep looking for a way to change it.Whichever manufacturer the chipset is being imported from, is having different codecs than samsung android.UPDATE 29MARCH2025:I received the headphones back from noise and they just sent back the same thing in broken state.I cannot imagine why a company is doing this. It's like ""here its back again but just in a diff box""Now again open a ticket and then send back item. Why did i purchase this from amazon in the first place. I should have gone to a shop purchased it. Atleast would not be facing this.Complete utter disregard to customer. Its customer problem. Let him be with a broken thing.========================Never seen such worse quality by paying this much money. Sound distorted right out from the box. Listen to audio -spotify or anything, even phone call, sound is heavily distorted. Any other of my old bluetooth headphones and earphones are fine. Breaks heavily in between. I do not know how even people gave it 5 stars. But if you hear a music, its as if like the audio tape is getting stuck in between.Not worth the money. Defective in sound right from the box. Never seen such bad quality that too for a higher priced item.And to top it, Amazon's stand is this has to be taken up with noise only. That too I just received it today.I opened up a ticket with noise. Will have to wait for their response.Have never seen such a worse pricey product.Read more; UPDATE 31MARCH2025: (This post will help people as I see many reporting issues with connectivity/distortion/quality. )The issue as I see is with Samsung Android devices and not with other phones like nothing 2a as a family member has that and this headphone works fine there.

These headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.Let's start with the build quality. Imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. They weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. Yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.Now, I'm a reasonable person. Accidents happen. So, I contacted NOISE support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. What I got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. They dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).So, here I am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. The audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. My advice? Steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. Unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.For those seeking a more constructive alternative:Do your research! Read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.Prioritize build quality. Look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.Understand the warranty terms thoroughly. Don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.Remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. Choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.Read more; I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS.

Er ist eine budgetfreundliche Option für alle, die nach einem praktischen und funktionalen Kopfhörer für den täglichen Gebrauch suchen.Vorteile:Faltbares Design: Der Sony MDR-ZX110AP lässt sich platzsparend zusammenfalten, was ihn besonders praktisch für unterwegs macht. Dieser kompakte Transportmodus ist ideal für Reisende oder Pendler.Gutes Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis: Für den relativ niedrigen Preis bietet dieser Kopfhörer eine solide Klangqualität und grundlegende Funktionen, die für alltägliche Musik- und Telefonanwendungen ausreichen.Headsetfunktion: Mit integriertem Mikrofon und Steuerungstasten am Kabel können Sie Anrufe entgegennehmen und Musik steuern, ohne das Smartphone herausnehmen zu müssen. Dies ist besonders praktisch für unterwegs.Bequemes Tragen: Die Ohrpolster sind angenehm gepolstert, was auch bei längeren Hörsessions für Komfort sorgt. Der verstellbare Bügel ermöglicht eine individuelle Anpassung für verschiedene Kopfgrößen.Leichtes Gewicht: Der Kopfhörer ist leicht und daher angenehm zu tragen, ohne dass er auf Dauer drückt oder schwer auf dem Kopf lastet.Nachteile:Klangqualität: Die Klangqualität ist für die Preisklasse akzeptabel, aber nicht herausragend. Der Bass könnte kräftiger sein, und bei höheren Lautstärken kann es zu Verzerrungen kommen. Audiophile könnten daher auf teurere Modelle ausweichen.Verarbeitung: Das Material des Kopfhörers fühlt sich eher plastisch an und könnte weniger robust wirken als teurere Modelle. Die Langlebigkeit könnte ein Thema sein, wenn der Kopfhörer intensiv genutzt wird.Keine Geräuschunterdrückung: Der MDR-ZX110AP bietet keine aktive Geräuschunterdrückung, was in lauten Umgebungen zu einem weniger isolierten Hörerlebnis führen kann.Kein Bluetooth: Der Kopfhörer ist kabelgebunden, was in Zeiten zunehmender Beliebtheit von kabellosen Modellen als Nachteil angesehen werden könnte. Für Nutzer, die Wert auf kabellose Freiheit legen, wäre dies ein wichtiger Punkt.Fazit:Der Sony MDR-ZX110AP ist ein empfehlenswerter Kopfhörer für Nutzer, die nach einem günstigen, praktischen und funktionalen Modell suchen. Seine faltbare Bauweise, die Headsetfunktion und der Komfort machen ihn zu einer soliden Wahl für den täglichen Gebrauch. Während die Klangqualität und die Materialverarbeitung nicht die höchsten Standards erreichen, bietet der Kopfhörer für seinen Preis ein gutes Gesamtpaket. Ideal für alltägliche Anwendungen und gelegentliches Musikhören, aber vielleicht nicht für besonders anspruchsvolle Hörerlebnisse.Read more; Der Sony MDR-ZX110AP ist ein faltbarer Bügelkopfhörer, der durch seine Headsetfunktion und sein kompaktes Design besticht.

Secondly the battery life is amazing, on a single charge I use this for like 40-45 Hrs and it still doesn't stop! Sound quality is decent in these but it's not cheap at all, tho i would say the durability is below average in these, but it's totally fine for an average user. Most importantly the mic is trash, i bought one of these in 2021 which broke in 2024 so I bought it again in 2024 and in both of the models, the mics did not work and that's the only drawback of this Headphone.Read more; The best headphones in this budget, I'm 6'3 and I have a big skull and ears but these fit perfectly on my head and are very comfortable!

Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is almost fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). It is average in terms of gaming. If you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. You can buy this headphone for games like Minecraft. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.Thank you for reading. Just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.Read more; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition.

Although I am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. There is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. Which is a pity, but ah well. Can't have it all, can ya?Best bluetooth headphones at 799 for sound AND mic quality. And let's not forget comfort. Headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.Although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.Even though I have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  Even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. So if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these. But if you don't mind going for EARPHONES, then there are many better options available in terms of sound quality.Read more; Surprisingly exceeded my expectations.

The ability to connect to multiple devices simultaneously and switch between them effortlessly adds to the convenience.; The boAt Rockerz 650 Pro is a solid offering for anyone looking for a feature-packed, stylish, and budget-friendly pair of wireless headphones. I’ve been using the Iris Black variant for a few days now, and here’s my honest take:🔊 Sound Quality (4.5/5):With Dolby Audio support, the sound is immersive, crisp, and detailed. Whether you're watching movies, listening to music, or gaming, the audio depth is impressive for this price point. Bass lovers will also enjoy the punchy lows without compromising mids and highs.✨ Touch/Swipe Controls (4/5):The touch/swipe gestures on the earcups are responsive and intuitive. It might take a little time to get used to, but once you do, it feels smooth and futuristic. No more fumbling for buttons!🔋 Battery Life (5/5):Absolutely insane! Up to 80 hours of playback is no joke. Even with moderate-heavy usage, you’ll easily get a week or more on a single charge. Plus, the ASAP fast charging gives several hours of playback with just 10 minutes of charging — super handy for last-minute top-ups.🎤 Call Quality (4.5/5):The dual mics with ENx tech offer great noise cancellation during calls. Even in noisy environments, the voice clarity remains top-notch. Great for meetings or long voice chats.📱 App Support & Dual Pairing (4/5):The boAt app adds a nice layer of customization — you can tweak the EQ settings, check battery levels, and even get firmware updates. Dual Pairing is also a neat feature, especially if you’re switching between a laptop and phone.🛠️ Build & Comfort (4/5):The build feels sturdy, and the cushioning on the earcups is plush and comfortable for long listening sessions.

I got the product in full chage after using it for 2 days almost 8-10 hours instagram,spotify and calling it dropped to 90%.It still have 70% and its been 4 days over a 20-25 hours of usage. Earpads are comfortable ears will get sweaty after an over or so but can't complain as its an over the ear. It could have been so great if it had ANC but again i don't think any good over the ear headphones comes with ANC in this price range. And to note I didn't felt any improvement in the sound with the dolby customization however it is there might be good while watching movies i guess. Haven't tried it yet. Don't know about the charging time since I have enough to last couple of days more. Size is ok suits best. Build quality is a 7/10. The earcup material is thin am afraid it may not last for a long time other than that its good. Accidental touches are there so you have to be careful with that one.Read more; Good one!!

They’re tight and feel sharp around the ears, not suitable for long use.Sound Quality: Just average. Bass is weak, vocals are flat, and overall sound is not immersive. Definitely not for music lovers or gamers.Battery Backup: Good battery life, but what’s the use if you can’t wear it comfortably?Latency: Claimed 45ms low latency – works fine for casual YouTube videos, but not ideal for fast-paced gaming.Verdict:Great looks, poor comfort, and average sound.

Amazing battery backup I only need to charge it once per week and I listen to music atleast 2 hrs everyday. The sound quality is great but you may need to use equilizers to adjust the bass since this one is specially designed for high bass. My OnePlus already provides different mode of audio settings depends on the use so no trouble for me. Durability is amazing. I dropped it 2 times from 5 ft and nothing happened not even a scratch but if you sit on it , it will break for sure. It's not water proof by the way, it can resist small drops of liquids whether sweat or water but I won't recommend these for gym . And it's on ear not over ear headphones. Prolonged use can hurt back of your ears.Read more; Bought this 3 months ago, am totally impressed.

Secondly the battery life is amazing, on a single charge I use this for like 40-45 Hrs and it still doesn't stop! Sound quality is decent in these but it's not cheap at all, tho i would say the durability is below average in these, but it's totally fine for an average user. Most importantly the mic is trash, i bought one of these in 2021 which broke in 2024 so I bought it again in 2024 and in both of the models, the mics did not work and that's the only drawback of this Headphone.Read more; The best headphones in this budget, I'm 6'3 and I have a big skull and ears but these fit perfectly on my head and are very comfortable!

Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is almost fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). It is average in terms of gaming. If you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. You can buy this headphone for games like Minecraft. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.Thank you for reading. Just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.Read more; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition. Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is almost fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). It is average in terms of gaming. If you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. You can buy this headphone for games like Minecraft. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.Thank you for reading. Just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.; Surprisingly exceeded my expectations. Although I am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. There is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. Which is a pity, but ah well. Can't have it all, can ya?Best bluetooth headphones at 799 for sound AND mic quality. And let's not forget comfort. Headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.Although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.Even though I have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  Even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. So if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these. But if you don't mind going for EARPHONES, then there are many better options available in terms of sound quality.Read more; Surprisingly exceeded my expectations.

The mic is good, i tested the mic on discord and calls...It's pretty well. Battery is superb as it's been two days since I they were 100% and now when am writing this review.....it's still at 90%. Sound Quality is good. Gaming is bit of controversial as some might find it good but lemme tell u one thing that the latency is always not good at this price point but these are good for any story mode games and ok ok for competitive games.Hope it helps☺️Btw I got them for 800 rs.Read more; These headphones are good for the price but there is only one major problem that is comfort...I mean that you will not be able to wear them for long sessions otherwise it's overall a banger considering it's price.

The addition of an SD Card reader and FM makes it a complete on the go music package that you can use without having your phone around. I do wish it had the memory inbuilt instead of having to insert an SD card along with a type C charging / data transfer port instead of a micro SD. Else it's a great device for the price.Read more; Good bass, near zero noise and great sound for its price.

Worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. Cuz I needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.3.Comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .4.Sturdiness and Build quality.5.Looks obviously , pictures were good but I didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.Quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.Now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. NOT A SINGLE CONCERN WAS FOUNDED TO BE TRUE.1.Mic is working absolutely fine. You can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. If you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. Now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). For all other purposes its perfect.2.I received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am I switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. It has been playing non stop. Its perfect. If you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. You don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). Battery life is sufficient. I haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. Anyway , by what I've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. Firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. Very comfortable. Its definitely over the ears and Completely covers them. Even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. Also , I dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , I've seen heavier gaming headphones. Don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .4.Build quality is very nice , Sturdy and strong. The speakers are tightly held with the band and while I don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. It loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . The RGB looks so beautiful and catchy. The overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . Is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. Everything is perfect. Though I wish now that I should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... It would've looked cooler with RGB.6. With Bluetooth , its justt Awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. Though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠Ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ I Like It (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). I don't play games so I can't talk bout Latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. Now talking bout the wired mode. It Might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. The clarity is just perfect and No latency ofcourse. No need of battery in aux mode. Can keep using it even if the battery is dead. I Like this feature so much. For a student like me , its a charmer. No unnecessary breaks . And With the full sound ☠️ You won't hear even if someone's getting murderrred in the next room ☠️ Its that awesome.  Sound does leak , but its tooo loud as well. I mean , its like a freakin mini speaker on medium volume when you keep it aside and max the volume. It is crazyyyy . You can just hang it on your neck if it gets too hot n you'll still hear everything.It is honestly my very first Wireless headphones.

Don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .4.Build quality is very nice , Sturdy and strong. The speakers are tightly held with the band and while I don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. It loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . The RGB looks so beautiful and catchy. The overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . Is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. Everything is perfect. Though I wish now that I should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... It would've looked cooler with RGB.6. With Bluetooth , its justt Awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. Though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠Ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ I Like It (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). I don't play games so I can't talk bout Latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. Now talking bout the wired mode. It Might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. The clarity is just perfect and No latency ofcourse. No need of battery in aux mode. Can keep using it even if the battery is dead. I Like this feature so much. For a student like me , its a charmer. No unnecessary breaks . And With the full sound ☠️ You won't hear even if someone's getting murderrred in the next room ☠️ Its that awesome.  Sound does leak , but its tooo loud as well. I mean , its like a freakin mini speaker on medium volume when you keep it aside and max the volume. It is crazyyyy . You can just hang it on your neck if it gets too hot n you'll still hear everything.It is honestly my very first Wireless headphones. But I have used Boat Rockerz which my friend has , And I can say without a doubt , Giving 200 more for this one is definitely worth it.The comfort , the looks , the loudness , the RGB (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). I even got 129 cashback so it had to be a steal deal for me 😁.I'm so glad I bought this as my first headphones. I was very skeptical but now that I'm using it 😍 , Its just a wonderful experience.Most negative comments I believe are one in hundred Instances or anomaly or exceptions. Most people DON'T review a product till it's defective. Only very few people review when the product it perfect.This is to help first timers like me or for anyone who want a good headphone.Don't worry bout anything , just go for it. Luck can be bad sometimes nd you might get a bad piece , just get it replaced nd voila , problems solved. Its not like 100% of manufactured products are bad ☠️. Anyway. Ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.; Great Budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together. Great build quality. Great fit can put straight for 2 to 3 hours, after it might feel a bit discomfort, depends on person to person. Great battery, brand claims 40hr and i get too around 38 to 39hr in it which says its approved for long hours. Very good sound quality, if you are confused between two headphones in this budget and you like BASS more, then pick this one it has great bass. So everything is good, but there is one major, very big problem which is kinda aceeptable for someone and not for a lot of pepole. The problem is Sound leakage, if you listen even above 50% vol or for some songs even at 30% vol, the sound starts to get outside earphone. your experience won't get bad for urself but the outsiders could also hear it which is why its not good to use it in public. if u go on 90% volume, rather than a headphone it becomes a speaker, u won't face any problem in ears, but voice outside will come loud easily hearable. It means brand gave everything, but could not block the speakers towards the outer end meaning voice gets outside easilyRead more; Great Budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together.

I got it for a nice deal (approx. Rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). I was reviewing multiple headphones under the Rs. 5k range. My first choice was the Sony CH-520, but I did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and I didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under Rs. 5k). The other options were Boat, Zebronics (a different set), Hammer and a variety of other ones.Among them I did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. I wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. It was available at a reasonable price and the RGB lights impressed me. So I ordered them.PROS:- Sounds good! I'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. No issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. The bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- Sturdy. The headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. While laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. I have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. They are still in good shape- RGB. The lights are definitely funky. They look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- Battery. Applaudable battery without hesitation. I use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.CONS:- Mic. I've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. My peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what I just said- Huge cushions and ear muffs! The size of the muffs are simply too big. When traveling with the headphones on in buses, I like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. But this is simply not possibly with these headphones. The muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. When I try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. So I'm forced to sit rigid for a while- Terrible button placement. The power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. This makes it very hard to use the controls. I have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. It's so ridiculous that I stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- Bad USB-C connection slot. The USB-C connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other USB-C wires because it has a narrow deep opening. So my phone's USB-C charger doesn't fit in it. Only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. This means I always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackOverall decent pair. In my previous (edited now) review, I mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. After several days I realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. So, I have edited my review and updated the ratingCheers!Read more; 3.5/5I have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. I got it for a nice deal (approx.

I am an Headphones enthusiast and own sets of premium Headphones like the Bose Qc series & Ultra and Bowers & Wilkins PX8 to Airpods Pro 2, Airpods4 and many more. I own Marshall Motif IIANC buds as well. Back to the pointThis is first pair of Marshall HEADPHONE. I want too much into this Brand till I owned the earphones which I actually liked it than airpods pro 2 plus it looked damm pretty with leather like texture on both buds and case.When i came across this model it immediately caught my attention with its looks and I realized it’s the latest model released few days back and available only in Amazon.Once received i was blown by the package and it oozed out premium look.The headphone looks so damm pretty with its aesthetic look and the Marshall branding in earcups gives the feel of 70s, 80s feel.The buds themselves fold so small that it fits neatly in the hard easter eggisque king of caseThe Comfort is exceptional. The moment you wear it the ear cushion feels like cotton placed on your ears. Its so dam soft!!The controls are minimalist yet effective.The App gives more room for customisation.The new feature that Marshsall introduced first time is soundstage. Its like spatial audio that we get in airpods et all but this unique. You can select the size of the room on how should the spatial sound and also select the percentage that is required. My settings kept was room size medium at 60%Boom! It actually makes a difference and seriously feels like and gives a concert like feeling. Take my word for that. I am a person who enjoys music and fascinated by Dolby or Spatial sound etc and this is by far the best I have heard. Amazed by how Marshall nailed it knowing that it’s their first time.Bass, mids and highs I don’t want to dwell much on it. It has a very balanced and natural sound and pleasing to ears. Bassheads stay away but I am sure even you will like it. Even I like bass but if all spectrum is covered equally its the better option and this gives exactly that.All I can say is I am amazed and happy with this purchase. I can also fairly say it is much better than my Bose Ultra Headphones on both sound & comfort and more comfortable & slightly more pleasing sound than my Bowers & WilkinsRead more; First thing first.

These are simply top of the line and superb to listen to. The comfort is exceptional and ANC works like a charm. Could not have asked for more seriously. The battery life is yet to be tested but the on paper specs are way above competition. The app is also very snappy and minimalistic but does the job of tweaking the settings to your listening preference.

The sound itself is good for a headphone at this price, slightly on the basy side, however the 7.1 surround which they provide with these headphones i found them a gimmick imho, like i didn't find much difference with it being on or off, tested in competitive games like pubg, valo and cs. footsteps, gunshots and directional sounds were clear and accurate even with the 7.1 surround off. One reason that i might feel such way is that i use nahimic as my primary sound software and eq. and i have surround enabled in there.As for music, the sound quality is good enough.The only thing which i don't like about this headphone is its cable. Firstly its thin and short, though you get the splitter cable along with it which can increase the overall length but who wants to use a splitter?! especially when the splitter itself is even thinner.Read more; I have been using these headphones for a week now with daily usage of about 10hrs and one thing that i can confidently say is that i did not feel any sort of discomfort or pain in the surrounding areas of the ears even after long hours of gaming, that's great.

Worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. Cuz I needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.3.Comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .4.Sturdiness and Build quality.5.Looks obviously , pictures were good but I didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.Quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.Now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. NOT A SINGLE CONCERN WAS FOUNDED TO BE TRUE.1.Mic is working absolutely fine. You can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. If you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. Now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). For all other purposes its perfect.2.I received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am I switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. It has been playing non stop. Its perfect. If you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. You don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). Battery life is sufficient. I haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. Anyway , by what I've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. Firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. Very comfortable. Its definitely over the ears and Completely covers them. Even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned.

I don't play games so I can't talk bout Latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. Now talking bout the wired mode. It Might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. The clarity is just perfect and No latency ofcourse. No need of battery in aux mode.

You can just hang it on your neck if it gets too hot n you'll still hear everything.It is honestly my very first Wireless headphones. But I have used Boat Rockerz which my friend has , And I can say without a doubt , Giving 200 more for this one is definitely worth it.The comfort , the looks , the loudness , the RGB (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). I even got 129 cashback so it had to be a steal deal for me 😁.I'm so glad I bought this as my first headphones. I was very skeptical but now that I'm using it 😍 , Its just a wonderful experience.Most negative comments I believe are one in hundred Instances or anomaly or exceptions. Most people DON'T review a product till it's defective. Only very few people review when the product it perfect.This is to help first timers like me or for anyone who want a good headphone.Don't worry bout anything , just go for it. Luck can be bad sometimes nd you might get a bad piece , just get it replaced nd voila , problems solved. Its not like 100% of manufactured products are bad ☠️. Anyway. Ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.Read more; The media could not be loaded.Before receiving the product, these were my concerns:-1. alot of reviews were bout how the mic is bad , hence I was concerned.2. Worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. Cuz I needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.3.Comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .4.Sturdiness and Build quality.5.Looks obviously , pictures were good but I didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.Quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.Now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. NOT A SINGLE CONCERN WAS FOUNDED TO BE TRUE.1.Mic is working absolutely fine. You can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. If you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. Now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). For all other purposes its perfect.2.I received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am I switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. It has been playing non stop. Its perfect. If you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. You don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). Battery life is sufficient. I haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. Anyway , by what I've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. Firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. Very comfortable. Its definitely over the ears and Completely covers them. Even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. Also , I dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , I've seen heavier gaming headphones.

Ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.; Great Budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together. Great build quality. Great fit can put straight for 2 to 3 hours, after it might feel a bit discomfort, depends on person to person. Great battery, brand claims 40hr and i get too around 38 to 39hr in it which says its approved for long hours. Very good sound quality, if you are confused between two headphones in this budget and you like BASS more, then pick this one it has great bass. So everything is good, but there is one major, very big problem which is kinda aceeptable for someone and not for a lot of pepole. The problem is Sound leakage, if you listen even above 50% vol or for some songs even at 30% vol, the sound starts to get outside earphone. your experience won't get bad for urself but the outsiders could also hear it which is why its not good to use it in public. if u go on 90% volume, rather than a headphone it becomes a speaker, u won't face any problem in ears, but voice outside will come loud easily hearable. It means brand gave everything, but could not block the speakers towards the outer end meaning voice gets outside easilyRead more; Great Budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together.

I got it for a nice deal (approx. Rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). I was reviewing multiple headphones under the Rs. 5k range. My first choice was the Sony CH-520, but I did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and I didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under Rs. 5k). The other options were Boat, Zebronics (a different set), Hammer and a variety of other ones.Among them I did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. I wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. It was available at a reasonable price and the RGB lights impressed me. So I ordered them.PROS:- Sounds good! I'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. No issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. The bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- Sturdy. The headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. While laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. I have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. They are still in good shape- RGB. The lights are definitely funky. They look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- Battery. Applaudable battery without hesitation. I use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.CONS:- Mic. I've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. My peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what I just said- Huge cushions and ear muffs! The size of the muffs are simply too big. When traveling with the headphones on in buses, I like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. But this is simply not possibly with these headphones. The muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. When I try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. So I'm forced to sit rigid for a while- Terrible button placement. The power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. This makes it very hard to use the controls. I have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. It's so ridiculous that I stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- Bad USB-C connection slot. The USB-C connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other USB-C wires because it has a narrow deep opening. So my phone's USB-C charger doesn't fit in it. Only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. This means I always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackOverall decent pair. In my previous (edited now) review, I mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. After several days I realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. So, I have edited my review and updated the ratingCheers!Read more; 3.5/5I have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. I got it for a nice deal (approx.

And volume is too loud 😍Bhaiyo kharid lo awesome product hai.Thankyou noise and Amazon for this best experience.😍; I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS. These headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.Let's start with the build quality. Imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. They weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. Yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.Now, I'm a reasonable person. Accidents happen. So, I contacted NOISE support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. What I got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. They dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).So, here I am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. The audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. My advice? Steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. Unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.For those seeking a more constructive alternative:Do your research! Read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.Prioritize build quality. Look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.Understand the warranty terms thoroughly. Don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.Remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. Choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.Read more; I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS. These headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.Let's start with the build quality. Imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. They weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life.

But then i read reviews for this and compared it over rtings.com and finally ended up getting these.I was not expecting much from the noise cancellation or the bass I only needed a comfortable headphones for my work day to focus.Oh boy was I surprised. The ANC is perfect for me. It wont drown out everything and sharp bursts of noise will come through, but anyway so complete silence is not what I need. At 50% volume (at which these sound amazing btw), it downs out the background droning noises to like 1% and I cant even tell my coworkers are speaking even if they are just 6 feet away from me (I can still here some mumbles but I wont be able to understand the words so I don't get distracted anymore).Coming to the sound, these are my first headphones so I can only compare it to my speakers. And I am comparing apples to oranges here but in comparison to that, these are not that great, but then again those cost like 4x as much and have much more hardware so this is a stupid comparison on my end anyway.So for these I only wanted two things - clarity and bass. These speakers have excellent quality when it comes to clarity and with the eq set to bass mode well these speakers do deliver some bass but it wont blow your mind away. But then I remember how cheap these are and I'd say they are 5/5 value for money.And these fold up too unlike the Sony ones so storage is much easier.I could not find any cons yet after my 1 wee use. Might edit this review if I find any.I would just recommend you wipe down the ear pads (which are extremely comfortable btw) once a week or so, otherwise they might get damaged coz again these are pretty cheap and they would have to do cost cutting somewhere.Read more; The media could not be loaded.This is my first ever JBL product (and my first ever over the head headphones).First of all, I love Japanese products and was initially leaning towards the Sony WH-CH720N.

It looks pretty good with impressive fit and finish. The buttons feel well built yet the headphone is quite light. It did not hurt my ears even after long hours of continuous use.Sound Quality: I am an audio visual production professional and I felt it sounds quite balanced (for a JBL) in the Eq off setting. Pump up the volume and it can get pretty loud. The 'super bass' eq mode really pumps up the bass. The bass response is deep with precise attacks and releases, does not sound boomy at all. I like how these headphones sound. The calling quality too is surprisingly good. It cuts most ambient noises coming into the microphone while on a phone call.ANC: Does the job Okay but there are much better ANC headphones available in the market. Compared to the Bose Quiet series, the apple airpods pro or even the Sony headphones with ANC these felt inferior. In my recent travel in an airplane, these headphones started crackling; especially while the airplane was taking off. The filtration of the aircraft engine sound kept varying throughout my three hours of flying.Ergonomics: It takes a little while to get used to the position of the buttons. I felt that the ANC on-off toggle button should have been placed on the other earpiece of the headphone and not along with the power button or the volume control/play-pause buttons. Again, takes a while to get used to this button position. The charging port is on the top side of the right earpiece. Thus, you cannot use the headphones while charging them. The wired connection option is definitely a handy option if you want to use them connected to a computer on a table. The wire is a TRRS jack and kept playing in mono when connected to a TRS only socket.Battery Backup: Very good battery backup so even with a continuous use with ANC for approx 6 hours and with about 60% volume on music and multiple phone calls, it just consumed 40% charge.Overall verdict: It's a good buy only if you have budget constraints and you're offered hefty discounts. If not then there are far better ANC headphones available in the market.Read more; I have been using various ANC headphones for years and I bought these because my Airpods Pro got spoilt and I forgot my Bose Quiet Control 30s at home while travelling.

So if you are a music lover and loves a lot of bass, it is not for you. You can amp up your bass from the device you have paired it to, but it doesn't hit anywhere close to premium bass quality. On the other hand if you watch a lot of Content which involves dialogues and documentaries, this is the perfect headphone for you as it gives amazing speech clarity. i would say this is also an Editors and Gamers Headphone, where communication is very important and speeches takes great importance over beats and rhythms. I like that we can Swap between Ambient aware and Noise cancellation, and it's greatest pro is the Battery life. This headphone as a very good battery life, you can run it for days without even realizing that you need to charge it. i use it for work, meetings and calls, and also for editing purpose, and i am happy with my purchase, but if i was a sound editor or into Audio Compositing i think there are better options in the market at the same price.Read more; This Headphone is a bag of mixed feelings, but let me break down what is good about it and what is missing.On one hand i feel there is a lack of Bass when i am listening to pop and upbeat music, but at the same time i works well when i am watching documentaries or doing editing as it enhances the audio by boosting its treble.

What’s worse is that there’s no repair option available—almost as if the company expects you to just buy a new pair for ₹7,000.

The ANC is also quite refined.

Whether I'm listening to music, watching movies, or taking calls, the audio quality remains consistently excellent, providing an immersive experience.The battery life on these headphones is outstanding. With up to 40 hours of playtime on a single charge, I rarely find myself reaching for the charging cable. When I do need a quick top-up, the quick charge feature is incredibly handy, providing several hours of playback with just a short charging session.Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity ensures a stable connection with minimal dropouts, and I appreciate the dual pairing feature that allows me to connect to two devices simultaneously. Switching between my phone and laptop is seamless, which adds to the overall convenience.The headphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods, thanks to the ergonomic design and plush ear cushions that provide a good seal while minimizing fatigue. The foldable design makes them easy to store and carry in the included pouch, perfect for travel or commuting.

But the fitting is uncomfortable.; Been using this for a month and here's what I can describe about this product. NOT the best product but for the price point in this brand? I really can't complain. The build product feels cheap, like plastic or maybe is it plastic? I don't know but it feels cheap with matte finish and simple design.The meat of the product, The sound quality is fine but the bass, I won't call it great yet won't call it decent. If I was given a scale to rate the bass of this speaker, I would give it 6.5 or 7 at best out of 10. Noise Cancelling is great here, haven't gotten issue with this part so far.The battery is fine, since I use it on everyday basis I think, I can get at best 3 to 4 hours a day without charging for a week's use.The comfort is assuring, I never once found discomfort using this product nor irritations, able to move around hassle-free. The cushion, however looks rugged which I personally don't like, was comfy providing protection to my hear.Honestly, I'd give this product 3.5 or 3.75 out of 5 overall, as I am not a huge fan of it's bass, it's just on the borderline mark, and the placeholder on where you need to charge, this particular product made me feel I was solving a rubix cube to find the placeholder. I have gone through the instructions but, at times when I'm on rush or something related to it, I don't find comfort finding the ports on this product.Read more; Been using this for a month and here's what I can describe about this product.

Whether I'm commuting or relaxing at home, they feel great even during extended use.The battery life is outstanding. It lasts so long that I almost forget to charge it!

These headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.Let's start with the build quality. Imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. They weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. Yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.Now, I'm a reasonable person. Accidents happen. So, I contacted NOISE support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. What I got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. They dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).So, here I am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. The audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. My advice? Steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. Unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.For those seeking a more constructive alternative:Do your research! Read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.Prioritize build quality. Look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.Understand the warranty terms thoroughly. Don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.Remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. Choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.Read more; I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS.

If you’re a music lover, you can definitely go for them.Size, Weight, and Durability (4.5 Stars)They are very lightweight and smaller in size compared to other headphones, making them perfect for music lovers.However, don’t expect them to be very durable if dropped, as the body is somewhat fragile.Gaming (4.5 Stars)The headphones are great for gaming, with clear sound for footsteps and other in-game audio details.The only reason I’m giving 4.5 stars instead of 5 is due to the microphone issue. However, you can get the flexible mic variant, which solves this problem.Comfort (4.5 Stars)Initially, they might feel a bit stiff, but as they loosen up over time, they become much more comfortable.You can use them for 2–3 hours at first, and once you're used to them, 3–4 hours comfortably. If needed, you can take a 5-minute break and continue using them for another 3–4 hours.Overall (Considering the Price Range)For music lovers: Definitely 5 stars.For gamers: With the flexible mic variant, it's 5 stars as well. If you already have an external mic for your PC or phone, the normal variant will work just fine.This is one of the best headphones available in the ₹1000 price range.

The battery life is amazing — I’m easily getting 35+ hours on a single charge, which is perfect for long travel or work-from-home days.The sound quality is good, especially if you're a bass lover. The bass is punchy and powerful, though sometimes it does drown out the mids and highs a bit.

The bass is punchy and powerful, though sometimes it does drown out the mids and highs a bit. It's not for audiophiles, but for casual music listening and gaming, it’s great.; The boAt Rockerz line is boAt's super cheap lineup for budget buyers. This will likely be many people's first foray into the world of wireless headphones, and is likely to turn many people off by its many compromises. It might be worth buying your grandma as a gift, but is  not something I'd ever recommend buying for your own use.1. Sound Quality - awful. Honestly, the boAt Rockerz 450 does little more than bring your phone's audio loser to your ears. It isn't any significant improvement over your phone's speaker, and might actually be an active downgrade from your computer's speakers. Most audio sounds tinny, there's little to no bass, and absolutely zero noise cancellation. On or off, you can and will hear the outside world. Those who carry wireless headphones to tune out the outside world on walks or airplanes will be sorely disappointed. The soundstage is very small and shallow, and even non-audiophiles will notice the poor sound quality.2. Comfort - Horrendous. The boAt Rockerz 450 is a pain to wear, both literally and figuratively. The audio sounds horrible, and your ears will feel horrible too after an hour of use, maybe less. The good battery life means nothing if you cant use these headphones for more than 45 minutes at a time. After removing these headphones, your ears will hurt for a long while, and you'll feel like never wearing these again. The cans are very small, even for on-ear headphones, and people with spectacles or large heads will be even worse off. The frame doesn't extend very far, and also slips down quite easily.3. Build Quality - In a word - bad. See a pattern here? The headphones reflect their low price point, and are  entirely made of cheap plastic. The plastic also doesn't flex much, and the headphones seem very easy to break by accident. It's worth noting that the cups don't extend much. If you're one of those guys who like to leave their headphones dangling around their neck when not in use, you'll find yourself unable to lower your head without your headphones biting into your jaw. Finally, the cups absorb a lot of sweat. You'l find yourself wanting to wash the cups and frustrated that you can't. It's really gross.5. Mic - Absolutely trash tier. You won't even be able to use the mic for how bad it is. I honestly forgot these headphones even had a mic because it's so soft and picks up so much background noise. Callers will not be able to hear you clearly and will keep urging you to switch back to your phone, and you can forget about trying to use these with your PC for voice chat or conference calls. Don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a mic with this headset - the mic only exists on paper. It's really not worth using.4. Final words - Just, don't. Spend a bit more, get a decent pair of wireless headphones. The headset doesn't even connect properly half the time, and when it does, you'll wish it didn't. Save  up some money, work at McDonalds, and treat yourself to some good headphones. Anything, but not these ones. The only good thing about these cans is the battery life, but what use it battery life if you don't want to use these headphones?1 BuildRead more; The boAt Rockerz line is boAt's super cheap lineup for budget buyers.

Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is almost fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). It is average in terms of gaming. If you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. You can buy this headphone for games like Minecraft. For music, this headphone is fantastic.

Although I am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. There is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. Which is a pity, but ah well.

Headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.Although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.Even though I have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  Even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. So if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these. But if you don't mind going for EARPHONES, then there are many better options available in terms of sound quality.Read more; Surprisingly exceeded my expectations. Although I am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device.

But if you don't mind going for EARPHONES, then there are many better options available in terms of sound quality.; These headphones are good for the price but there is only one major problem that is comfort...I mean that you will not be able to wear them for long sessions otherwise it's overall a banger considering it's price. The mic is good, i tested the mic on discord and calls...It's pretty well. Battery is superb as it's been two days since I they were 100% and now when am writing this review.....it's still at 90%. Sound Quality is good. Gaming is bit of controversial as some might find it good but lemme tell u one thing that the latency is always not good at this price point but these are good for any story mode games and ok ok for competitive games.Hope it helps☺️Btw I got them for 800 rs.Read more; These headphones are good for the price but there is only one major problem that is comfort...I mean that you will not be able to wear them for long sessions otherwise it's overall a banger considering it's price.

The addition of an SD Card reader and FM makes it a complete on the go music package that you can use without having your phone around. I do wish it had the memory inbuilt instead of having to insert an SD card along with a type C charging / data transfer port instead of a micro SD. Else it's a great device for the price.Read more; Good bass, near zero noise and great sound for its price.

"Sony WH-CH520 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery-Black","₹4,490",4.1,B0BS1PRC4L,https://www.amazon.in/Sony-Bluetooth-Headphones-Multipoint-Connectivity/dp/B0BS1PRC4L/ref=sr_1_10?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.V_bYlHxSSNsRtMi091znFH0NnD6dwyc2Z7IwbSPgRH2cYvYaNlb3nmxh7s3OP_GTyUvunJpamvJnQKxue5D0CJ3XlaK9HBwToCKywGWfM9MsX26kRGXcOccJYAGJrz6EuwizfiX5SOj_BwSvNPEaBGFzNG_oW2N-m62uni9A8Luz_IFDIblN9eUhDpxMpgGg-CssPzRI7x7P3XMqNr_KMrBt41R8mpgk1kLaTGLFuYo.LKRVfLl5uCb4HDxjuWzS8jFtJhKSp7QmL_YQWmWlvY0&dib_tag=se&keywords=headphones&qid=1747130623&sr=8-10,"So if you're considering to buy this pair of headphones or have already brought it and need a little tweak to the sound to up the excitement, give this review a read. I know it's somewhat lengthy :( but if you've already bought this pair, skip to the last part, that is, bonus.Sound quality:-Pretty good. As you might know, Sony is Sony when it comes to sound. The audio is clear and has that calm, balanced profile that I prefer to the bass oriented profiles of BoAt and JBL. If you are a basshead, I don't think these headphones will be your go to. But if you've been using bass heavy headphones, you will feel and instant change in audio quality and the overall beauty of music once you switch to a Sony device. Keep in mind that I'm not a professional audiophile or something. I love listening to quality music and watching movies and these headphones are perfect. I use Apple music and the sound is bliss, idk about Spotify though but I think it will fare equally well. I like bass and these headphones do provide bass, just that they are not overkill and distort the entire sound looking for it. These feel more premium in the sound department. However some people might feel a lack of excitement in their sound out of the box. Worry not, I've added an EQ tweak to fix your problem at the end of this review.Specs:-30mm drivers. So not as loud as the 40mm ones BoAt and JBL offer in this price range. But I've felt (personally) the audio quality to be better. Bluetooth 5.2 which is solid. Multipoint connection makes sure that this will not be outdated soon. They've been released in 2023 and will remain in contention for atleast a couple of years. Multipoint has to be turned on in headphones app and I use it to connect the headphones to my Macbook to watch movies and to my android phone, which might be on charging or in another room, to attend calls. The switching is seamless and works well. They don't have touch controls though, so it will take a couple of tries to learn to get the buttons right, especially in a dark room. They have DSEE which is basically a feature to enhance low quality/ compressed audios downloaded from internet. It has to be turned on in the app and is not needed for Spotify or Apple music as they are already best quality music and DSEE takes up additional battery charge. Battery is solid. They were 70% out of the box and after 20 hr playback still had 50% left. So I guess they'll last for atleast 50 hrs like they claim on the box. I don't like charging my devices all the time and I use them for max 5 hrs a day for which they will last close to 2 weeks which is good. No ANC though, it's not a problem for me but if it is for you, don't buy. Mic is good, I've attended calls in the midst of traffic and they were pretty fine.Comfort:-I've tried many midrange headphones and these are some of the best in terms of comfort too. Soft earcups that sit compact on my ear. However if they are not positioned properly, they might exert pressure. But on proper positioning, they will give 2 to 2.5 hours playback without any discomfort. After that you will have to take a break. I don't have big ears btw. They are lightweight and have an adjustable headband with cushion. So as far as on ear headphones are concerned, these are comfortable.Build:-Plastic but feels durable. Not creaking. The earcups are the types which forms wrinkles, they look durable but I don't know if they will pinch unless I use it for atleast 6 months. Anyway these have replacement earcups available online and in Sony service centers. I have one near my house. I don't think they are sweat resistant so don't use it for workouts. For jogging they will stay in place once positioned compactly, but for running they will slip off ear.Drawbacks:-Lack of aux cable. Once you are out of charge, that's that. It says they support fast charging on box, but I haven't tried that so idk. Normally takes 2 hours atleast to charge from 20 to 100. Another drawback is portability. They are not foldable and even though the plastic feels durable, I'd suggest you don't bump them much. While travelling either buy a case or carry them around in the box they come with (don't worry about looking cheap, the box doesn't have anything like specs or other bs written on it. Only thing written is Sony. It's inside the white cover that mentions specs).Conclusion:-They offer value for money if you ask me. The sound is premium for a budget segment and not too bass oriented. The headphone app means it will get firmware updates and has some listening modes that actually work, it is not a gimmick. They look and feel premium too. And unlike Anker or ATH, they have service centers all over so if any issue pops up, that's an added boost too. The don't have an in box warranty card but worry not, the moment you connect your device to the headphones app they are registered. Keep the Amazon invoice with you, in the box or download it in pdf form from your orders section.Bonus:-If the headphones lack excitement to you out of the box, the headphones app offer some preset EQ. But I will share this tweak I found from reddit. They worked for me so if you don't know how to configure the EQ on your own, try this;Select manual on EQ in Sony headphones app.Put 400 to 2.Put 1k to 4.Put 2.5k to 7.Put 6.3k to 7.Put 16k to 5.Put clear bass to 2.Try out this tweak and see if it works for you. This works on some higher end Sony models too. Enjoy your headphones!!!Read more; So if you're considering to buy this pair of headphones or have already brought it and need a little tweak to the sound to up the excitement, give this review a read.

Thank to Sony service.; Muy cómodos, en mi trabajo participo en muchas reuniones virtuales y hay días en que los traigo puestos tal vez 5 o 6 horas seguidas sin quitármelos y no me molestan, a veces hasta se me olvida que los traigo. Excelente conectividad bluetooth con el celular y laptop, se pueden conectar ambos a la vez. En el gimnasio los he usado corriendo y haciendo todo tipo de ejercicios y son cómodos, ligeros y no se mueven. Los he sudado y la cubierta de las almohadillas no se ha dañado nada. El audio es buenísimo, muy bien nivelado y aunque no tienen cancelación de ruido, con un volumen moderado y por las mismas almohadillas, aisla lo suficientemente bien como para que los ruidos o música del gimnasio, por ejemplo, queden muy en el fondo. Nunca ha sido necesario subir al máximo el volumen. Además con la app puedes ecualizar a tu gusto, también recomiendo, si usas Spotify, ecualizar ahí para tener la mejor experiencia posible. La batería dura muchísimo, en 3 meses de uso usándolos en promedio 3 o 4 horas diarias y solo los he puesto a cargar 3 veces. Cargan muy rápido también. El único detalle que les he encontrado es que con mi SmartTV Hisense, jugando Playstation tiene un delay de medio segundo o 1 segundo, y con Youtube cada 40 segundos o 1 minuto ""se brinca"" o ""se come"" como 1 segundo tanto del audio como del video. Pero para mi no ha sido problema porque realmente solo los uso para escuchar música desde mi celular y para tener llamadas de trabajo. En resumen, son cómodos, lucen bien, sobrios y de buena calidad, muy buen audio y excelente rendimiento de batería.Read more; Muy cómodos, en mi trabajo participo en muchas reuniones virtuales y hay días en que los traigo puestos tal vez 5 o 6 horas seguidas sin quitármelos y no me molestan, a veces hasta se me olvida que los traigo.

Nunca ha sido necesario subir al máximo el volumen. Además con la app puedes ecualizar a tu gusto, también recomiendo, si usas Spotify, ecualizar ahí para tener la mejor experiencia posible. La batería dura muchísimo, en 3 meses de uso usándolos en promedio 3 o 4 horas diarias y solo los he puesto a cargar 3 veces. Cargan muy rápido también. El único detalle que les he encontrado es que con mi SmartTV Hisense, jugando Playstation tiene un delay de medio segundo o 1 segundo, y con Youtube cada 40 segundos o 1 minuto ""se brinca"" o ""se come"" como 1 segundo tanto del audio como del video. Pero para mi no ha sido problema porque realmente solo los uso para escuchar música desde mi celular y para tener llamadas de trabajo. En resumen, son cómodos, lucen bien, sobrios y de buena calidad, muy buen audio y excelente rendimiento de batería.; Best quality nice soundRead more; Best quality nice sound; I've had thse headphones, for two months now, for the gym and I still have not charged them since the day I got them. I cannot say enough.Read more; I've had thse headphones, for two months now, for the gym and I still have not charged them since the day I got them. I cannot say enough.; The product arrived well packaged.  There was a delivery delay but it was not horrendous and to be expected given that it was ordered during Parime Days,The headphones arrived almost fully charged,  Set up was relatively easy, but you really do need to use their app to complete the set up process.  The app also allows you to change some settings and select equalizer settings that work for you.The switches have a nice feel to them.  They do have raised areas designed to help you find the correct switch by feel.  There are times however when I find that it is easier to adjust the volume using the phone or I remove the headphone to make a change.  This is a very subjective items so you may not have the same issue.  No stars were deducted for that reason.These are an on ear device.  It was not uncomfortable to me, but it did take some getting used to and here again...Personal preference comes into play.  On a warm and humid day you may experience some sweating where the ear cup rides on your ear.  That may allow for some movement / shifting of the headphone depending on what you are doing.  They may thus not work out well for use doing exercising as an example.The sound quality is great at this price point.  I have Bose ear buds.  The sound from this device is not Bose quality and you should not expect it to be Bose quality.  It is good to very good however.  The equalizer settings allow you to control all five typical equalizer settings PLUS a separate adjustment for th4 bass.Paring was easy and fast.  The connection remains stable most of the time.  There is a selection that allows you to select either top quality sound or a more stable connection.  I chose sound quality an the vast majority of the time the connection was stable with no noise present.  There may be times however, that due to local conditions / interference you may have a little popping or very brief drop out.  I have worn these headphones a LOT since they arrived and while I have experienced that, it was very limited.  Now I also have a lot of electric / electronic devices in use on my property and that will may explain what I experienced.  I did have some interference from some household devices when I wass very close to them.The battery life seems to be very good.  I have worn m for several hours and the voice system still indicates 100% at startup. Unlike my Bose products the battery monitoring system is not linear where it will call out 100%, 90%, 80%b etc...  It may call out 100% until the battery hits 50% (As an example) and then te voice system will drop from stating 100% to 50%.  I do not see that as an issue or negative given the very long stated by the manufacturer battery life, and I have no disagreement with their claims about battery life aty this point in time,So again...Thus far I am very pleased with the fit, quality, and sound quality of these headphones.  Do bed aware that tey are NOT noise cancelling.  There will be some outside noise reduction dur to the ear cups of course.Read more; The product arrived well packaged.

Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is almost fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). It is average in terms of gaming. If you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. You can buy this headphone for games like Minecraft. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.Thank you for reading. Just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.Read more; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition.

Although I am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. There is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. Which is a pity, but ah well. Can't have it all, can ya?Best bluetooth headphones at 799 for sound AND mic quality. And let's not forget comfort. Headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.Although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.Even though I have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  Even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. So if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these. But if you don't mind going for EARPHONES, then there are many better options available in terms of sound quality.Read more; Surprisingly exceeded my expectations.

I will Discuss all the Questions asked Above and will also Tell you How to Identify The Fake Product. And will give you a Solution For Best Performance.  Lets Begin the Review :================UNBOXING REVIEW :================1 -  EARPHONE2- WARRANTY CARD3- ADDITIONAL EAR BUDS4- MANUALS=================EARPHONE REVIEW :  (3.5* out Of 5 Value For Money 💰 )=================4* out of 5  for Premium Looks.4* out of 5 for Build Quality.4* out of 5 for Comfortable.3.5* out of 5 for Sound Quality3.5 * Out of 5 for Bass Quality.3* out of 5 for Treble.3* out of 5 for Noise Cancellation.3.5 * out of 5 for Ear bud Quality==============================ADVANTAGES / Why Should You buy :===============================1-  Premium Looks at this price Range2- Good BUILD QUALITY in this Price.3- JBL is a trusted Brand.4- Good Comfortable while Listening.5- It has a Mic .6- Warranty Of 1 year.===========================================WHY I Gave Medium Ratings/Value For Money 💰=3.5*============================================I got Really Disappointed as for Quality of sound. These are the cons i Felt.1-  Quality of Sound is not above Average. In this price range We can get Higher Quality of Sound from Panasonic she, Skull candy. I was Expecting alot from JBL.2- i am not happy with the noise cancellation for a Earphone of price 1399 (without offer). I expect alot as i am a Music Lover.3- Mic is not that Clear , Low voices are Difficult to transmit. Not at all happy with this.4- If You are really a  Music Lover or you like Quality of Music always , i will not Recommend you. There are other options in this Price range.=======================How To check Fake Product :=======================Step 1-  In front of the Box  , Under C100SI you will see its Written ""In EAR HEADPHONES"".  It Must be Written in white Colour. If its Written in Red or anyOther ,its a duplicate.Step 2- Turn the Box to back side , Your price will be written in a separate Paper. (Small) like a Sticker.  Duplicate will have a Big Sticker.Step 3- Open the Box , In orginal You will get Warranty card but Not in duplicate.Step -4 : The size of Mic should be Small, not a wide in comparison with Duplicate.Step -5 : JBL logo should be Bold and written with Premium .Step 6- Go to YouTube , Check bass Checking Videos ,if your Earphones are sustainable ,then your is orginal.=================================How to Enhance / Get Better Efficiency :=================================If you have already Purchased it and thinking how to Increase the bass and Quality,  i will recommend Go to Play store, there are plenty of Music apps where to customize basses and all needs. I will suggest Go for POWERAMP music player. I personally In Love with that app.=============CONCLUSION :=============This product which is 1399 (without Discount) is really Not Worthy for Value of Money. But if  this Product is Under 699 (offer) than its a Good Deal if you want a Mic . So for me VALUE FOR MONEY 💰-= 3.5 *============MY OPINION :============IF You want a Earphone which have A premium Looks with mic Under This price Range then Go for it.If you want an Earphone Under 500 , Go for Philips Extra Bass . For Mic  Mi In ear.If you want an Earphone under 600-650, Go for Panasonic she , for MiC Sony MDR 150 Ap.If You want an Earphone under 700-800, Go For Cx 180, for Mic Go for this product.If You want an Earphone under 1000k Go for One piston.If you want an Earphone under 1200k Go for SONY MDR XB 55.IF YOU want an Earphone under 2K with mic Go for SONY MDR XB 55AP.I have Used all the products and Recommending you. If you want those Reviews, Go to my profile and check the Reviews..=====================Was my Review HELPFUL :======================I hope i have Discussed all the questions asked above. If you still have some, You can comment Below .i will Help you as soon as possible.Sorry For this Long Review, Thanks For Your Patience. Have a Safe and Productive Day ahead.

Lets Begin the Review :================UNBOXING REVIEW :================1 -  EARPHONE2- WARRANTY CARD3- ADDITIONAL EAR BUDS4- MANUALS=================EARPHONE REVIEW :  (3.5* out Of 5 Value For Money 💰 )=================4* out of 5  for Premium Looks.4* out of 5 for Build Quality.4* out of 5 for Comfortable.3.5* out of 5 for Sound Quality3.5 * Out of 5 for Bass Quality.3* out of 5 for Treble.3* out of 5 for Noise Cancellation.3.5 * out of 5 for Ear bud Quality==============================ADVANTAGES / Why Should You buy :===============================1-  Premium Looks at this price Range2- Good BUILD QUALITY in this Price.3- JBL is a trusted Brand.4- Good Comfortable while Listening.5- It has a Mic .6- Warranty Of 1 year.===========================================WHY I Gave Medium Ratings/Value For Money 💰=3.5*============================================I got Really Disappointed as for Quality of sound. These are the cons i Felt.1-  Quality of Sound is not above Average. In this price range We can get Higher Quality of Sound from Panasonic she, Skull candy. I was Expecting alot from JBL.2- i am not happy with the noise cancellation for a Earphone of price 1399 (without offer). I expect alot as i am a Music Lover.3- Mic is not that Clear , Low voices are Difficult to transmit. Not at all happy with this.4- If You are really a  Music Lover or you like Quality of Music always , i will not Recommend you. There are other options in this Price range.=======================How To check Fake Product :=======================Step 1-  In front of the Box  , Under C100SI you will see its Written ""In EAR HEADPHONES"".  It Must be Written in white Colour. If its Written in Red or anyOther ,its a duplicate.Step 2- Turn the Box to back side , Your price will be written in a separate Paper. (Small) like a Sticker.  Duplicate will have a Big Sticker.Step 3- Open the Box , In orginal You will get Warranty card but Not in duplicate.Step -4 : The size of Mic should be Small, not a wide in comparison with Duplicate.Step -5 : JBL logo should be Bold and written with Premium .Step 6- Go to YouTube , Check bass Checking Videos ,if your Earphones are sustainable ,then your is orginal.=================================How to Enhance / Get Better Efficiency :=================================If you have already Purchased it and thinking how to Increase the bass and Quality,  i will recommend Go to Play store, there are plenty of Music apps where to customize basses and all needs. I will suggest Go for POWERAMP music player. I personally In Love with that app.=============CONCLUSION :=============This product which is 1399 (without Discount) is really Not Worthy for Value of Money. But if  this Product is Under 699 (offer) than its a Good Deal if you want a Mic . So for me VALUE FOR MONEY 💰-= 3.5 *============MY OPINION :============IF You want a Earphone which have A premium Looks with mic Under This price Range then Go for it.If you want an Earphone Under 500 , Go for Philips Extra Bass . For Mic  Mi In ear.If you want an Earphone under 600-650, Go for Panasonic she , for MiC Sony MDR 150 Ap.If You want an Earphone under 700-800, Go For Cx 180, for Mic Go for this product.If You want an Earphone under 1000k Go for One piston.If you want an Earphone under 1200k Go for SONY MDR XB 55.IF YOU want an Earphone under 2K with mic Go for SONY MDR XB 55AP.I have Used all the products and Recommending you. If you want those Reviews, Go to my profile and check the Reviews..=====================Was my Review HELPFUL :======================I hope i have Discussed all the questions asked above. If you still have some, You can comment Below .i will Help you as soon as possible.Sorry For this Long Review, Thanks For Your Patience. Have a Safe and Productive Day ahead. Jai 🇮🇳.; Da ich zu der Sorte Mensch gehöre, die quasi 24/7 In-Ear Kopfhörer trägt, habe ich im Laufe der Zeit schon die verschiedensten Modelle ausprobiert. Teure, billige, hoch gelobte, Nieschenprodukte, online gekauft und offline erworben... Da meine letzten Kopfhörer gerade mal 2 Monaten durchhielten (Amazon erklärte sich netterweise bereit den Kaufpreis zu erstatten), musste ein neues Paar In-Ears her. Meine Wahl fiel auf diese hier in der roten Ausführung, auch weil sie farblich gut zu meiner roten Nintendo Switch passen. :,DBei dem kleinen Preis hatte ich nicht viel erwartet. Doch beim Auspacken schon die erste positive Überraschung: Die Gummiohrstöpsel fühlten sich hochwertig an, richtig weich! Das hatte ich schon anders erlebt. Direkt in die Ohren gefrummelt und die nächste Überraschung: Unglaublich angenehmes Tragegefühl, man merkt die In-Ears kaum. Dennoch schirmen sie Außengeräusch gut ab. Dann aber der ultimative Bewährungstest: Kopfhörer ans Handy angeschlossen und meine SEHR abwechslungsreiche Playlist rauf- und runtergehört. Kurz und knapp: Ich bin begeistert. So gut haben sich bisher noch keine anderen In-Ears geschlagen. Die Musik klingt richtig natürlich und unverfälscht und sogar mit ordentlich Bass können sie umgehen. Dazu kommt, dass ich manche Lieder auch gern mal sehr laut höre, doch selbst damit kommen die In-Ears klar! Bei voll aufgedrehter Lautstärke machen sie ORDENTLICH Krach! :DIch glaube ich habe hier meine neuen Immer-wieder-bestell-Kopfhörer für die nächsten Zeit gefunden. :)Read more; Da ich zu der Sorte Mensch gehöre, die quasi 24/7 In-Ear Kopfhörer trägt, habe ich im Laufe der Zeit schon die verschiedensten Modelle ausprobiert.

"Sony WH-CH520 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery-Blue","₹4,375",4.1,B0BS1RT9S2,https://www.amazon.in/Sony-Bluetooth-Headphones-Multipoint-Connectivity/dp/B0BS1RT9S2/ref=sr_1_15?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.V_bYlHxSSNsRtMi091znFH0NnD6dwyc2Z7IwbSPgRH2cYvYaNlb3nmxh7s3OP_GTyUvunJpamvJnQKxue5D0CJ3XlaK9HBwToCKywGWfM9MsX26kRGXcOccJYAGJrz6EuwizfiX5SOj_BwSvNPEaBGFzNG_oW2N-m62uni9A8Luz_IFDIblN9eUhDpxMpgGg-CssPzRI7x7P3XMqNr_KMrBt41R8mpgk1kLaTGLFuYo.LKRVfLl5uCb4HDxjuWzS8jFtJhKSp7QmL_YQWmWlvY0&dib_tag=se&keywords=headphones&qid=1747130623&sr=8-15,"So if you're considering to buy this pair of headphones or have already brought it and need a little tweak to the sound to up the excitement, give this review a read. I know it's somewhat lengthy :( but if you've already bought this pair, skip to the last part, that is, bonus.Sound quality:-Pretty good. As you might know, Sony is Sony when it comes to sound. The audio is clear and has that calm, balanced profile that I prefer to the bass oriented profiles of BoAt and JBL. If you are a basshead, I don't think these headphones will be your go to. But if you've been using bass heavy headphones, you will feel and instant change in audio quality and the overall beauty of music once you switch to a Sony device. Keep in mind that I'm not a professional audiophile or something. I love listening to quality music and watching movies and these headphones are perfect. I use Apple music and the sound is bliss, idk about Spotify though but I think it will fare equally well. I like bass and these headphones do provide bass, just that they are not overkill and distort the entire sound looking for it. These feel more premium in the sound department. However some people might feel a lack of excitement in their sound out of the box. Worry not, I've added an EQ tweak to fix your problem at the end of this review.Specs:-30mm drivers. So not as loud as the 40mm ones BoAt and JBL offer in this price range. But I've felt (personally) the audio quality to be better. Bluetooth 5.2 which is solid. Multipoint connection makes sure that this will not be outdated soon. They've been released in 2023 and will remain in contention for atleast a couple of years. Multipoint has to be turned on in headphones app and I use it to connect the headphones to my Macbook to watch movies and to my android phone, which might be on charging or in another room, to attend calls. The switching is seamless and works well. They don't have touch controls though, so it will take a couple of tries to learn to get the buttons right, especially in a dark room. They have DSEE which is basically a feature to enhance low quality/ compressed audios downloaded from internet. It has to be turned on in the app and is not needed for Spotify or Apple music as they are already best quality music and DSEE takes up additional battery charge. Battery is solid. They were 70% out of the box and after 20 hr playback still had 50% left. So I guess they'll last for atleast 50 hrs like they claim on the box. I don't like charging my devices all the time and I use them for max 5 hrs a day for which they will last close to 2 weeks which is good. No ANC though, it's not a problem for me but if it is for you, don't buy. Mic is good, I've attended calls in the midst of traffic and they were pretty fine.Comfort:-I've tried many midrange headphones and these are some of the best in terms of comfort too. Soft earcups that sit compact on my ear. However if they are not positioned properly, they might exert pressure. But on proper positioning, they will give 2 to 2.5 hours playback without any discomfort. After that you will have to take a break. I don't have big ears btw. They are lightweight and have an adjustable headband with cushion. So as far as on ear headphones are concerned, these are comfortable.Build:-Plastic but feels durable. Not creaking. The earcups are the types which forms wrinkles, they look durable but I don't know if they will pinch unless I use it for atleast 6 months. Anyway these have replacement earcups available online and in Sony service centers. I have one near my house. I don't think they are sweat resistant so don't use it for workouts. For jogging they will stay in place once positioned compactly, but for running they will slip off ear.Drawbacks:-Lack of aux cable. Once you are out of charge, that's that. It says they support fast charging on box, but I haven't tried that so idk. Normally takes 2 hours atleast to charge from 20 to 100. Another drawback is portability. They are not foldable and even though the plastic feels durable, I'd suggest you don't bump them much. While travelling either buy a case or carry them around in the box they come with (don't worry about looking cheap, the box doesn't have anything like specs or other bs written on it. Only thing written is Sony. It's inside the white cover that mentions specs).Conclusion:-They offer value for money if you ask me. The sound is premium for a budget segment and not too bass oriented. The headphone app means it will get firmware updates and has some listening modes that actually work, it is not a gimmick. They look and feel premium too. And unlike Anker or ATH, they have service centers all over so if any issue pops up, that's an added boost too. The don't have an in box warranty card but worry not, the moment you connect your device to the headphones app they are registered. Keep the Amazon invoice with you, in the box or download it in pdf form from your orders section.Bonus:-If the headphones lack excitement to you out of the box, the headphones app offer some preset EQ. But I will share this tweak I found from reddit. They worked for me so if you don't know how to configure the EQ on your own, try this;Select manual on EQ in Sony headphones app.Put 400 to 2.Put 1k to 4.Put 2.5k to 7.Put 6.3k to 7.Put 16k to 5.Put clear bass to 2.Try out this tweak and see if it works for you. This works on some higher end Sony models too. Enjoy your headphones!!!Read more; So if you're considering to buy this pair of headphones or have already brought it and need a little tweak to the sound to up the excitement, give this review a read.

Today only I needed to charge it.Battery went from 20% to full charge in about 2 hours.App:With the Sony Headphones app, a lot of settings can be adjusted, logs can be tracked and many more...Final Words:The Sony WH CH-520 is the best choice for music lovers who are looking for an affordable yet branded headphones which delivers 37hrs of HQ audio playback.I purchased it for ₹4,490/- and just after my purchase the price dropped to ₹3,990/-So, it will be worth every penny if you can get it for a price of ₹3,990/-.; Nice headphone, comfort to both ears, sound clarity awesome, actually in sound systems Sony is top no other brand can't reach Sony brand sound quality, finally I loved it. Thank to Sony service.Read more; Nice headphone, comfort to both ears, sound clarity awesome, actually in sound systems Sony is top no other brand can't reach Sony brand sound quality, finally I loved it. Thank to Sony service.; Muy cómodos, en mi trabajo participo en muchas reuniones virtuales y hay días en que los traigo puestos tal vez 5 o 6 horas seguidas sin quitármelos y no me molestan, a veces hasta se me olvida que los traigo. Excelente conectividad bluetooth con el celular y laptop, se pueden conectar ambos a la vez. En el gimnasio los he usado corriendo y haciendo todo tipo de ejercicios y son cómodos, ligeros y no se mueven. Los he sudado y la cubierta de las almohadillas no se ha dañado nada. El audio es buenísimo, muy bien nivelado y aunque no tienen cancelación de ruido, con un volumen moderado y por las mismas almohadillas, aisla lo suficientemente bien como para que los ruidos o música del gimnasio, por ejemplo, queden muy en el fondo. Nunca ha sido necesario subir al máximo el volumen. Además con la app puedes ecualizar a tu gusto, también recomiendo, si usas Spotify, ecualizar ahí para tener la mejor experiencia posible. La batería dura muchísimo, en 3 meses de uso usándolos en promedio 3 o 4 horas diarias y solo los he puesto a cargar 3 veces. Cargan muy rápido también. El único detalle que les he encontrado es que con mi SmartTV Hisense, jugando Playstation tiene un delay de medio segundo o 1 segundo, y con Youtube cada 40 segundos o 1 minuto ""se brinca"" o ""se come"" como 1 segundo tanto del audio como del video. Pero para mi no ha sido problema porque realmente solo los uso para escuchar música desde mi celular y para tener llamadas de trabajo. En resumen, son cómodos, lucen bien, sobrios y de buena calidad, muy buen audio y excelente rendimiento de batería.Read more; Muy cómodos, en mi trabajo participo en muchas reuniones virtuales y hay días en que los traigo puestos tal vez 5 o 6 horas seguidas sin quitármelos y no me molestan, a veces hasta se me olvida que los traigo.

I cannot say enough.Read more; I've had thse headphones, for two months now, for the gym and I still have not charged them since the day I got them. I cannot say enough.; The product arrived well packaged.  There was a delivery delay but it was not horrendous and to be expected given that it was ordered during Parime Days,The headphones arrived almost fully charged,  Set up was relatively easy, but you really do need to use their app to complete the set up process.  The app also allows you to change some settings and select equalizer settings that work for you.The switches have a nice feel to them.  They do have raised areas designed to help you find the correct switch by feel.  There are times however when I find that it is easier to adjust the volume using the phone or I remove the headphone to make a change.  This is a very subjective items so you may not have the same issue.  No stars were deducted for that reason.These are an on ear device.  It was not uncomfortable to me, but it did take some getting used to and here again...Personal preference comes into play.  On a warm and humid day you may experience some sweating where the ear cup rides on your ear.  That may allow for some movement / shifting of the headphone depending on what you are doing.  They may thus not work out well for use doing exercising as an example.The sound quality is great at this price point.  I have Bose ear buds.  The sound from this device is not Bose quality and you should not expect it to be Bose quality.  It is good to very good however.  The equalizer settings allow you to control all five typical equalizer settings PLUS a separate adjustment for th4 bass.Paring was easy and fast.  The connection remains stable most of the time.  There is a selection that allows you to select either top quality sound or a more stable connection.  I chose sound quality an the vast majority of the time the connection was stable with no noise present.  There may be times however, that due to local conditions / interference you may have a little popping or very brief drop out.  I have worn these headphones a LOT since they arrived and while I have experienced that, it was very limited.  Now I also have a lot of electric / electronic devices in use on my property and that will may explain what I experienced.  I did have some interference from some household devices when I wass very close to them.The battery life seems to be very good.  I have worn m for several hours and the voice system still indicates 100% at startup. Unlike my Bose products the battery monitoring system is not linear where it will call out 100%, 90%, 80%b etc...  It may call out 100% until the battery hits 50% (As an example) and then te voice system will drop from stating 100% to 50%.  I do not see that as an issue or negative given the very long stated by the manufacturer battery life, and I have no disagreement with their claims about battery life aty this point in time,So again...Thus far I am very pleased with the fit, quality, and sound quality of these headphones.  Do bed aware that tey are NOT noise cancelling.  There will be some outside noise reduction dur to the ear cups of course.Read more; The product arrived well packaged.

The vocals are clear if you increase your volume to 50% + but it does have a con will share in a moment- if you are under 20 age with small to medium head then it is suitable for you :)- yes the SD card works very well just make sure your SD card is clean and only has .mp3 files.-Gamers you can go for it if you don't play sports! Then go for it, Emin gaming mode it has very minimal latency which unfortunately I can't count but yeah I play a lot of games so it is working very well, you can play in 80% volume no leakage :) depends on the game also! The aux cable and gaming mode both works equally same and is really good :)- Voice call quality is 8/10 :)CONS:-if you have bigger head don't buy it, it will fit your head easily but then the cushions will start hurting in 3-4 hours so yeah like I have medium to bigger head so it hurts a bit after some hours-Cushions doesn't absorb any sweat!- it has sound leakage issue so basically above 60% or above 50% the sound comes out! Well it depends on what you are listening if it's phonk then stay low at 40-50% trust me it still sounds good! If you are listening to simple lofi songs then go for 60% + so yeah!- the ENC is a joke here 😂- in gaming the sounds of gunshots are a bit too loud so yeahSo yeah a 4 day review and yes it is worth it and value for money product also a year warranty is also there haha!Will update after some weeks of usage :)Edit : so after months of usage it's still like when I bought ❤️ perfect durable looks are still good also the sound quality at this price range is perfect also every method works and connectivity is fast, for me using everyday 3-6 hrs works easily for 10 days! You don't even need to turn on gaming mode coz the normal mode is just so good! Barely any latency, the enc is clickbait I don't think it works but honestly for me when I wear it and play music or meeting calls and other multimedia at at least 50-60 volume : I can't hear noise at all barely audible so that's good!

Here’s a rundown of my experience with them over the past three months:Battery Life:The battery life is truly impressive. I’ve been able to enjoy extended listening sessions without constantly worrying about recharging. This feature alone makes the Rockerz 450 Pro an excellent value for the price.Sound Quality:The sound quality is top-notch. The audio is clear, well-balanced, and offers a great listening experience across various genres. Whether I’m tuning in to my favorite music or taking calls, the sound remains consistently good.Design:The design is both stylish and comfortable. The headphones are lightweight and fit well, making them perfect for long hours of use without discomfort. Plus, they look great!Mic Quality:However, one area where the Rockerz 450 Pro falls short is the microphone quality. During calls, the mic doesn't perform as well, which can be frustrating if you plan to use these headphones frequently for communication.Build Quality:Additionally, the build quality may seem a bit fragile. While they haven't broken on me, they do give off a slight impression of being weak. This is something to consider if you're looking for a highly durable option.Overall:These headphones deliver in many aspects—from battery life to sound quality to design. If you’re looking for a budget-friendly option that doesn’t compromise on performance but can overlook a couple of minor drawbacks, the Boat Rockerz 450 Pro is definitely worth considering.Read more; I recently got my hands on the Boat Rockerz 450 Pro headphones, and they have exceeded my expectations, especially considering the discount price I paid.

The headphones are lightweight and fit well, making them perfect for long hours of use without discomfort. Plus, they look great!Mic Quality:However, one area where the Rockerz 450 Pro falls short is the microphone quality. During calls, the mic doesn't perform as well, which can be frustrating if you plan to use these headphones frequently for communication.Build Quality:Additionally, the build quality may seem a bit fragile. While they haven't broken on me, they do give off a slight impression of being weak. This is something to consider if you're looking for a highly durable option.Overall:These headphones deliver in many aspects—from battery life to sound quality to design. If you’re looking for a budget-friendly option that doesn’t compromise on performance but can overlook a couple of minor drawbacks, the Boat Rockerz 450 Pro is definitely worth considering.; Poor product It has a high chance of breaking. Rockers 450 Pro A very nice headphone, but it has one downside, which is that if you pull it too hard, there is a high chance of breaking it. The headphone is already very good, the sound is very good.And these cushions are not that soft and will hurt your ears if you wear them for too long, it's only okay for an hour.I would rate the headphones 3.5%.Read more; Poor product It has a high chance of breaking.

I had high expectations from the bass quality. It is not very good, I'd say decent enough but not good enough. As someone that listens to music a lot it's definitely not the best. But it's okay-okay. What I want to say next is that the quality isn't good. The wire easily gets tampered. It already has a few dents even after I've handled it with good care. Sometimes it doesn't work properly. I need to put it in and out 2 times before it works. Overall I regret buying this kinda. But yeah it's decent enough for now.Read more; I brought this after viewing reviews.

I've been using them for a while, and here's my honest take on what they have to offer.Connectivity & Ease of Use:Let’s start with one of the essentials—connectivity. The OnePlus Bullets Z2 nails it with seamless Bluetooth connectivity that just works. Pairing them with my phone was as simple as it gets, and once connected, they stay that way without any annoying drops. The button placement on the neckband is intuitive, and after a day or two of use, I could easily control playback without needing to glance down, thanks to muscle memory. It’s the kind of convenience you don’t realize you need until you have it.Sound Quality - Balanced Yet Personal:Now, onto the sound quality. As someone who values a balanced sound signature, I found the Z2 to be a great match for my taste. Whether I'm listening to some mellow jazz, electronic beats, or even rock, the sound remains well-rounded and crisp. The highs, mids, and lows don't overpower each other, making it perfect for those who don't want their ears blasted with bass or overwhelmed by treble.That said, sound quality is a subjective experience, and preferences can vary widely. If you're a bass head looking for those earth-shaking lows, you might find these a tad restrained. But if, like me, you appreciate a balanced output across genres, these will hit the right notes for you.Battery Life & Quick Charging - A Week of Peace:Battery life is another highlight. With moderate use—think about 1-2 hours daily—you can stretch a single charge to last an entire week. Even if you’re a heavy listener, using them for 6-8 hours straight, they can hold up for around 2-3 days before needing a recharge. And the quick charge feature is a lifesaver—just 10 minutes of charging gets you 2-4 hours of extra playtime, which is perfect for those “oops, I forgot to charge them” moments.Gaming & Low Latency - Smooth Experience:I spend a fair bit of time playing games like BGMI, and the low latency mode on the Bullets Z2 makes a noticeable difference. There's minimal lag between the visuals and the audio, which makes for a much more immersive gaming experience. It's not just about the sound being clear; it's also about it being on time, and these earphones deliver that pretty well.Comfort & Passive Noise Isolation:Comfort is key when it comes to neckbands, and the Z2 doesn’t disappoint. They come with multiple earbud sizes, so you can pick the one that fits snugly for you. While there’s no active noise cancellation (ANC) here, you can achieve a decent level of passive noise isolation by choosing the right ear tips. This makes a noticeable difference in cutting out background noise during commutes or at the office.App Experience & Annoying Blinking Light:Now, onto a couple of quirks. The Bullets Z2 uses the HeyMelody app, which offers additional features like custom sound settings. However, my unit just wouldn’t connect with the app, which was a bummer. So, any fancy tweaks you could make through the app were out of my reach, and I had to rely solely on the default Bluetooth pairing. While everything worked smoothly once connected, I feel like I missed out on some customization options that might have enhanced my experience.Another thing that bugged me was the small white light that blinks when the neckband is connected to a device. It might not seem like a big deal, but if you’re using the earphones in a dark room or while lying down, that blinking light can be pretty distracting. Plus, it probably drains the battery a bit, albeit a small amount. A simple option to turn this off in the app would’ve been a nice touch.Final Thoughts - A Solid Pick for Most, with Room for Improvement:Overall, the OnePlus Z2 delivers where it matters—good sound quality, reliable connectivity, and battery life that won’t have you constantly reaching for the charger. It’s not perfect, especially with the blinking light and app connectivity issues, but those are minor compared to the solid performance it offers.

It might not satisfy those who crave earth-shattering bass, but for most listeners, it's a worthy contender at its price point.; There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking. They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.The earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating.Pairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.You get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.As for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.If you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.That said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.They come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.The Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass.Read more; There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking. They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.The earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating.Pairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.You get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.As for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.If you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.That said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality.

The fit is good and the design is nice in my opinion, very slim and light weight. Despite the magnetic connection of the earbuds being the only way to power down the device this has not been an issue, they snap together and power down flawlessly. They are comfortable and the connection is the fastest I've ever seen and they connect to my S24 within a few seconds after separating the magnetic backs of the earbuds. Sound quality is decent, but the price and functionality has surpassed expectations as I've been using them for over 5 months and I've only had to charge them maybe once every other week for like 30 minutes.Read more; Bought these for the 2-3 hours a week I am at the gym and the battery life is good.

Yes 6k is just the initiation of good quality ANC bluetooth over the ear headset, people are expecting XM or bose or Sennheiser quality in 6k or 8k,lol....if it's in 8k or 10k range i would give it 4🌟 instead. Here's my findings —Pros:-1. Sound output - 4.5/5 ... Default sound is pretty flat, but quickly gets interesting after playing with eq, dsee, anc etc. . Sound volume is pretty average but distortion in max vol. is low. It's a general purpose headset, good enough for all aspects like rock, pop, bass,instrumental, classical, rap etc. . Seperation is nice, different tones have distinct identities. But for specific needs like for bass or vocal, strech your budget a bit more. I don't think you can get better than this balance of sound output in this budget.2. ANC - 4/5 actually it's pretty decent, but could be a little better. Afterall it's an entry level ANC.3. Built - 4.5/5 simplistic plastic built, no fancy cosmetics, but solid and mature, very much flexible, not gonna break anytime, good elasticity for sticking with head. Though it's plastic built but has stainless steel housing around stretchable arms which is very nice to have for long term usage. Most headsets break from this sections.4. Battery- 5/5 fabulous battery life even with anc on . Charging it like smartphones from 20 to 90% and getting about 1 week to 10 days of battery life with intense usage. Charging takes about 50 mins for the above session.5. Comfort - 4/5 nice padded ear cups, but brings sweat quickly and then feels a bit warm... But prolonged usage doesn't hurt that much as once i had used it about 2hrs at a single strech.6. Connectivity- 5/5 very strong bluetooth connectivity, works seamlessly even with 10 meters of distance with walls and different floors.But still not that useful for online gaming via wireless mode as it has a little bit of latency.Cons. :-1. Crap when connected to PC via wire and headset turned off.2. Like other over the ear, gets uncomfortable in scorching summer and humid conditions.3. Lack of ldac , hence no hi-res audio, but in this price bracket it's ok.4. Though doesn't feel cheap, but some aesthetics should be there.Verdict:- You can absolutely go with it if you are getting it around 6000/- for no specific taste. Don't expect it to outperform those ult or XMs, it's illogical to think. If you want the ultimate one then there are XM, momentum, quitecomfort or those beyerdynamics....instead of going with intermediates, either go with this one or go with those super expensive ones. And those people comparing it with much lower priced headphones and saying it worse, they simply don't have the sensitivity to differentiate between subtle frequencies, and those subtle frequencies make it sweet.'Made for iPhone/iPod' written on the outside of the box, which is strange, probably will work better with ios than android. I'm an android user (pixel) though:).At last, it's a sweet headphone.Those images are after 6 months of usage!!Read more; I am using it continuously for last 6 months and gave it 5🌟 overall for the things it offers in the price of just 6k...

The sound quality is truly remarkable, delivering a rich and immersive audio experience that brings my music and podcasts to life. Whether I'm jamming to my favorite tunes or engrossed in a podcast, the clarity and depth of the sound are truly impressive.One of the standout features for me is the microphone's noise cancellation capabilities. While it may not completely eliminate all background noise, it does a commendable job of reducing ambient sounds during calls. The result is clear and crisp communication without the distractions of external noise. It's perfect for virtual meetings and online gaming sessions where effective communication is key.The design of the headphone is sleek and comfortable, making it suitable for extended wear. The over-ear cups provide a snug fit without causing discomfort, and the adjustable headband ensures a customized and secure fit. The build quality also feels robust, indicating durability for everyday use.I appreciate the user-friendly controls that allow me to adjust volume, skip tracks, and manage calls effortlessly. The Bluetooth connectivity is reliable, providing a stable connection with my devices without any noticeable lag.Overall, this headphone is a solid choice for anyone seeking a combination of excellent sound quality and decent noise cancellation. It strikes a great balance between performance and affordability, making it a valuable addition to my audio gear. Highly recommended!Read more; I recently purchased this headphone and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations.

Ele é leve, emparelha com todos os meus dispositivos e carrega rapidamente.  A redução de ruídos é muito boa também. Contudo, fiquei um pouco frustrada mesmo por ele não vir com o estojo para viagem, que é vendido de forma avulsa e custa quase R$200,00. Se eu tivesse me atentado a esse detalhe, teria pagado um pouco mais em um modelo mais avançado. Outro ponto que para mim é negativo é que ele pesa um pouquino e sinto os maxilares travarem no início, mas depois de algum tempo me adapto e não sinto mais incômodo.Enfim, é uma boa opção de fone, mas se estiver disposto a pagar um pouco a mais é melhor comprar um modelo mais recente.Read more; Estou satisfeita com o fone.

NOT A SINGLE CONCERN WAS FOUNDED TO BE TRUE.1.Mic is working absolutely fine. You can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. If you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. Now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). For all other purposes its perfect.2.I received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am I switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. It has been playing non stop. Its perfect. If you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. You don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). Battery life is sufficient. I haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. Anyway , by what I've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. Firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. Very comfortable. Its definitely over the ears and Completely covers them. Even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. Also , I dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , I've seen heavier gaming headphones. Don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .4.Build quality is very nice , Sturdy and strong. The speakers are tightly held with the band and while I don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. It loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . The RGB looks so beautiful and catchy. The overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . Is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. Everything is perfect. Though I wish now that I should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... It would've looked cooler with RGB.6. With Bluetooth , its justt Awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. Though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠Ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ I Like It (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). I don't play games so I can't talk bout Latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. Now talking bout the wired mode. It Might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. The clarity is just perfect and No latency ofcourse. No need of battery in aux mode. Can keep using it even if the battery is dead. I Like this feature so much. For a student like me , its a charmer. No unnecessary breaks . And With the full sound ☠️ You won't hear even if someone's getting murderrred in the next room ☠️ Its that awesome.  Sound does leak , but its tooo loud as well. I mean , its like a freakin mini speaker on medium volume when you keep it aside and max the volume. It is crazyyyy . You can just hang it on your neck if it gets too hot n you'll still hear everything.It is honestly my very first Wireless headphones.

If you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. Now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). For all other purposes its perfect.2.I received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am I switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. It has been playing non stop. Its perfect. If you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. You don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). Battery life is sufficient. I haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. Anyway , by what I've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. Firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. Very comfortable. Its definitely over the ears and Completely covers them. Even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. Also , I dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , I've seen heavier gaming headphones. Don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .4.Build quality is very nice , Sturdy and strong. The speakers are tightly held with the band and while I don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. It loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . The RGB looks so beautiful and catchy. The overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . Is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. Everything is perfect. Though I wish now that I should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... It would've looked cooler with RGB.6. With Bluetooth , its justt Awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. Though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠Ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ I Like It (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). I don't play games so I can't talk bout Latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. Now talking bout the wired mode. It Might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. The clarity is just perfect and No latency ofcourse. No need of battery in aux mode. Can keep using it even if the battery is dead. I Like this feature so much. For a student like me , its a charmer. No unnecessary breaks . And With the full sound ☠️ You won't hear even if someone's getting murderrred in the next room ☠️ Its that awesome.  Sound does leak , but its tooo loud as well. I mean , its like a freakin mini speaker on medium volume when you keep it aside and max the volume. It is crazyyyy . You can just hang it on your neck if it gets too hot n you'll still hear everything.It is honestly my very first Wireless headphones. But I have used Boat Rockerz which my friend has , And I can say without a doubt , Giving 200 more for this one is definitely worth it.The comfort , the looks , the loudness , the RGB (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). I even got 129 cashback so it had to be a steal deal for me 😁.I'm so glad I bought this as my first headphones. I was very skeptical but now that I'm using it 😍 , Its just a wonderful experience.Most negative comments I believe are one in hundred Instances or anomaly or exceptions. Most people DON'T review a product till it's defective. Only very few people review when the product it perfect.This is to help first timers like me or for anyone who want a good headphone.Don't worry bout anything , just go for it. Luck can be bad sometimes nd you might get a bad piece , just get it replaced nd voila , problems solved. Its not like 100% of manufactured products are bad ☠️. Anyway. Ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.; Great Budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together. Great build quality. Great fit can put straight for 2 to 3 hours, after it might feel a bit discomfort, depends on person to person. Great battery, brand claims 40hr and i get too around 38 to 39hr in it which says its approved for long hours. Very good sound quality, if you are confused between two headphones in this budget and you like BASS more, then pick this one it has great bass. So everything is good, but there is one major, very big problem which is kinda aceeptable for someone and not for a lot of pepole. The problem is Sound leakage, if you listen even above 50% vol or for some songs even at 30% vol, the sound starts to get outside earphone. your experience won't get bad for urself but the outsiders could also hear it which is why its not good to use it in public. if u go on 90% volume, rather than a headphone it becomes a speaker, u won't face any problem in ears, but voice outside will come loud easily hearable. It means brand gave everything, but could not block the speakers towards the outer end meaning voice gets outside easilyRead more; Great Budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together.

I got it for a nice deal (approx. Rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). I was reviewing multiple headphones under the Rs. 5k range. My first choice was the Sony CH-520, but I did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and I didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under Rs. 5k). The other options were Boat, Zebronics (a different set), Hammer and a variety of other ones.Among them I did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. I wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. It was available at a reasonable price and the RGB lights impressed me. So I ordered them.PROS:- Sounds good! I'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. No issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. The bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- Sturdy. The headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. While laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. I have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. They are still in good shape- RGB. The lights are definitely funky. They look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- Battery. Applaudable battery without hesitation. I use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.CONS:- Mic. I've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. My peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what I just said- Huge cushions and ear muffs! The size of the muffs are simply too big. When traveling with the headphones on in buses, I like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. But this is simply not possibly with these headphones. The muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. When I try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. So I'm forced to sit rigid for a while- Terrible button placement. The power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. This makes it very hard to use the controls. I have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. It's so ridiculous that I stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- Bad USB-C connection slot. The USB-C connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other USB-C wires because it has a narrow deep opening. So my phone's USB-C charger doesn't fit in it. Only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. This means I always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackOverall decent pair. In my previous (edited now) review, I mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. After several days I realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. So, I have edited my review and updated the ratingCheers!Read more; 3.5/5I have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. I got it for a nice deal (approx.

Sound is literally low, that means you have to increase the volume 80-90% to get a decent sound. If you do this, then quite obvious, that you won’t be able to get good battery backup. Trebles and vocals are good but bass is very minimal. Mic quality is good, people can hear you on the other end. Hinge is plastic, so doubtful about the sturdiness.

Secondly the battery life is amazing, on a single charge I use this for like 40-45 Hrs and it still doesn't stop! Sound quality is decent in these but it's not cheap at all, tho i would say the durability is below average in these, but it's totally fine for an average user. Most importantly the mic is trash, i bought one of these in 2021 which broke in 2024 so I bought it again in 2024 and in both of the models, the mics did not work and that's the only drawback of this Headphone.Read more; The best headphones in this budget, I'm 6'3 and I have a big skull and ears but these fit perfectly on my head and are very comfortable!

Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is almost fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). It is average in terms of gaming. If you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. You can buy this headphone for games like Minecraft. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.Thank you for reading. Just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.Read more; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition.

Although I am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. There is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. Which is a pity, but ah well. Can't have it all, can ya?Best bluetooth headphones at 799 for sound AND mic quality. And let's not forget comfort. Headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.Although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.Even though I have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  Even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. So if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these. But if you don't mind going for EARPHONES, then there are many better options available in terms of sound quality.Read more; Surprisingly exceeded my expectations.

I love listening to music and podcasts all day! But audiophile level headphones are expensive and usually start around 4k-5k Rs! But after loads of youtube research, I got these for 2700 and it was a good decision!The music feels way better than my old Boat Rockerz 600! It's definitely an upgrade! Everything is well balanced, and instrument seperation is good. And with the supported app I can make detailed adjustments for my needs! It's got great bass too, for bass lovers! And the vocals felt clear.The headphones do not support Hi-Res audio, but that's okay because honestly most of us don't use Hi-Res music platforms anyways. So don't think it's not gonna sound good because of no Hi-Res support. But the headphones do have AAC codec support over bluetooth which is good, and it also has aux support which sounds even better!Comfort wise, these are 'on-the-ear' headphones(ones that don't cover the ear), so obviously a bit tight on your ears. They honestly do get a bit uncomfortable after 1.5-2 hrs of wearing, but they are very secure. So if you wanna use them in gym or while running or jogging, these won't fall off easily! The ear cushions are like what you find in most midrange headphones of around 2k price. Not too hard, not too soft.Does not have a gaming mode, significant lag over bluetooth. But it has wired option which means zero lag when using via 3.5mm jack. I play CoD Mobile and BGMI with it and had no issues!Mic is decent. Not the highest quality, not for recording, but still clear enough for calls. No issues there as well!Battery life is decent. Not too less, not too long! I use these on an average of 4-5 hours per day, and in 3 days it goes from 100% to 40%, so you get a general idea.Ppl are saying the control buttons are small and difficult to access, but I had no issues.

Il peut y avoir l’affichage de la batterie et avoir une alerte pour batterie faible. Charge USB C super rapide !! L’application permet de connecter 2 appareils en même temps. Ainsi si on utilise sur iPad, pas besoin de déconnecter pour utiliser sur iPhone. Les deux sont paramétrés. Connexion sans aucun problème, en 1 seconde. Aucun décrochage pendant près de 3h d’affilée (pas testé plus, mais si ça devait se déconnecter, ça l’aurait fait !). Pas de grésillement du tout. Se plie. Les écouteurs peuvent se plier et se mettre à plat. Ils peuvent aussi bouger pour placer idéalement sur les oreilles. Rembourrage super. En haut du casque et autour des écouteurs.

But once you open it the headphone itself is very light and the materials is decent so it doesn’t give you that premium feeling. That was my issue, like the Xm4s feel a lot nice and feels like you've paid the money for it, these feel a little plasticy and fragile.Comfort => 10The weight being less is a great factor when it comes to comfort, they sit so lightly on the head and the earcups are large enough that there is no touching anywhere.Noise cancelling => 10The noise cancelling is better than the XM4s by like a good 10-15%, you can tell difference in the first few seconds of wearing it. Does a good job without creating that vacuum pressure.Sound => 8The sound off the box is VERY flat. There was no punch in the sound and was a little underwhelming. But the Bose app has a basic EQ that lets you customize it a bit which really helped bring this thing to life.

Premium-ish feel but decent. Light and comfortable.BT connectivity - Just fine. I did face a minor glitch where one earcup did not work initially but resetting the headphone has done the job for now. If it repeats, I’ll probably replace the headphones.Features - NC is pretty good. I have just used products with ANC, and not NC. From my perspective, its a delight. For sound geeks, this does have some kind of channel imbalance where the right cup has higher sound as compared to the left. It is not really noticable but just a headsup.Lastly the battery life is great.

I’ll say as a successor to the XB series this one definitely is a level above. At Ult 2 mode, the increase in bass, even though it’s significant amount of bass, does not make the overall sound mushy or reduces the clarity that you hear when Ult is off. I like it, even heavy metal sounds good with Ult on. I’d say apart from sound, battery is the second most impressive point about this product. I easily get one entire week out of 5-6 hours use daily. The app is good, you have more than enough customisation capabilities. The hard case is of good quality, this headphone is not at all compact by any means, so the storage method is twisting it to a very specific position to get it inside the case, which can be tricky and might even break the stems as this is a all plastic product, but overall the case is smaller due to that reason and no issue, you’ll get the hang of it after a week. I use the audio jack when using with playstation, just plug it into the controller 3.5 mm port and sound is really good with fit that is comfortable for hours of gaming, that does not consume headphone battery as well. ANC is like 8/10 quality, but I guess someone who hasn’t used apple airpods pro gen 2 before can easily say this is a great headphone with ANC considering its a headphone and not a earphone. I use transparency/ambient mode mostly, which is a solid 10! You can even control how much amount of outside noise you’ll want to pass on to your ears from the app, which you can’t in apple.Read more; Been using this headphone for over 6 months now.

Im a basic audio enthusiast and an avid music lover.. My personal taste of audio is a mixed one.. I waited so long and after many years Sony ultimately launched this ULT headphone that perfectly fits my taste of music.. I usually prefer only headphones for listening music and watching movies as they completely cover up your ears and drives powerful audio straight to your sealed ears.. That is a different experience than the in ear or TWS ones.. And I definitely need BASS without any compromise on mid section, the highs, sound to be rich, clean with decent stereo staging.. This one satisfies all that.. I do use EQ to tweak settings for my taste and once setup, hell yeah it is just out of the world!! I dont understand why many reviews downplay music quality like mids, highs, crispness, stereo staging etc but this one does all that with that massive bass too!! Either there are headphones with rich audio clarity but lacks on bass or there are the other bassy ones that makes other aspects sound trash.. But this one for me is an all rounder.. Music which has only rich vocals, string sections without much bass lines too sound soo good same as music with immersive bass.. By bass I dont mean just the upper bass which gives you headache but the really low end rumbles extending deeper to sub 20Hz or even less which you can actually feel.. I feel like Im in an IMAX theatre or somewhere straight into the studios after I put this up.. Even for ppl who dont like bass there is an option to completely switch it off.. For me it works wonders with the first ULT mode.. That is damn impressive.. Everyone whom I asked to listen this was just blown away.. I really love it..I have tried many brands like Sennheiser Momentum plus (diaphragm distortion) even at moderate volume so returned back, then JBL not satisfied with audio quality though had bass, then some new companies like SonicLamb which fakes the bass (No bass less than 40Hz or so but will fake with some artificial vibrations) which I threw to trash.. Finally this is the real and clean one for my budget..I don't even look into Noise cancelling as I mostly listen music only indoors but this actually does a pretty good job and silences the outer noise by almost half.. Most of the times I don't even need it indoors..Likewise i rarely make calls with this but that is pretty good as well..Bluetooth connection and latency is fine for me as I'm not gamer.. Connection is very stable and it can connect two devices at once..Battery is also pretty good so as the charging time..If I have to speak about some cons, the headphone always runs with noise cancelling mode on by default even if you toggle it through headphone control.. Ambient noise mode off does not actually turn off, but the mics work even harder to amplify external noises so that you can hear everything around.. Everytime you have to get the app running and set like while detecting as 'Staying' then completely turn off noise cancelling feature.. As a person who is not interested much on this aspect I don't have to put this extra load to the headphone and I have to switch it off manually through the app everytime..And I also prefer the headphones to be more louder.. Some movies or videos have very low volume and even at highest volume it's not loud enough..But these are manageable and overall I think Sony really nailed with this headphone..!!Read more; These headphones are just bang for the bucks!!

When it comes to the sound quality that's beyond my expectation. I'm completely satisfied with the sound quality and bass. Though this product is specially for bass lovers you can adjust bass level and also use Equalizer for music control in the sound connect app by sony. So, this product is not only for bass lovers and also for a music lovers. Battery life is too good. I use it for 4-5 hours a day but I charge this product every 10 days so battery backup is good. Comfort is too good. I'm using this product for past 15 days and there is no discomfort or any pain in my ears. Only problem is sometimes I noted is as it covers your ear so you might get sweat in ears. If you use it in AC room no chance for sweat. So this is what I experienced using this product. Hope this experience might help others to take decision.Read more; Overall quality of the product is good and worth the money. When it comes to the sound quality that's beyond my expectation.

This will likely be many people's first foray into the world of wireless headphones, and is likely to turn many people off by its many compromises. It might be worth buying your grandma as a gift, but is  not something I'd ever recommend buying for your own use.1. Sound Quality - awful. Honestly, the boAt Rockerz 450 does little more than bring your phone's audio loser to your ears. It isn't any significant improvement over your phone's speaker, and might actually be an active downgrade from your computer's speakers. Most audio sounds tinny, there's little to no bass, and absolutely zero noise cancellation. On or off, you can and will hear the outside world. Those who carry wireless headphones to tune out the outside world on walks or airplanes will be sorely disappointed. The soundstage is very small and shallow, and even non-audiophiles will notice the poor sound quality.2. Comfort - Horrendous. The boAt Rockerz 450 is a pain to wear, both literally and figuratively. The audio sounds horrible, and your ears will feel horrible too after an hour of use, maybe less. The good battery life means nothing if you cant use these headphones for more than 45 minutes at a time. After removing these headphones, your ears will hurt for a long while, and you'll feel like never wearing these again. The cans are very small, even for on-ear headphones, and people with spectacles or large heads will be even worse off. The frame doesn't extend very far, and also slips down quite easily.3. Build Quality - In a word - bad. See a pattern here? The headphones reflect their low price point, and are  entirely made of cheap plastic. The plastic also doesn't flex much, and the headphones seem very easy to break by accident. It's worth noting that the cups don't extend much. If you're one of those guys who like to leave their headphones dangling around their neck when not in use, you'll find yourself unable to lower your head without your headphones biting into your jaw. Finally, the cups absorb a lot of sweat. You'l find yourself wanting to wash the cups and frustrated that you can't. It's really gross.5. Mic - Absolutely trash tier. You won't even be able to use the mic for how bad it is. I honestly forgot these headphones even had a mic because it's so soft and picks up so much background noise. Callers will not be able to hear you clearly and will keep urging you to switch back to your phone, and you can forget about trying to use these with your PC for voice chat or conference calls. Don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a mic with this headset - the mic only exists on paper. It's really not worth using.4. Final words - Just, don't. Spend a bit more, get a decent pair of wireless headphones. The headset doesn't even connect properly half the time, and when it does, you'll wish it didn't. Save  up some money, work at McDonalds, and treat yourself to some good headphones. Anything, but not these ones. The only good thing about these cans is the battery life, but what use it battery life if you don't want to use these headphones?1 BuildRead more; The boAt Rockerz line is boAt's super cheap lineup for budget buyers.

I has shortlisted 3 headphones -Sennheiser Momentum 4,  Sony -XM5 and the Bose QuietComfort Ultra. The Bose one seemed overpriced as it has exactly similar quality to the other two (as per various youtube reviews) but has a bad battery backup and worse with the immersive audio. Finally It was a tough decision to make between the Sony and Sennheiser and i finally went with the Sennheiser Momentum 4.The pair of headphones are just amazing and is a treat to my ears. The ANC is amazing , you will hardly hear anything when it is running on full power. The earcups are very much comfortable and also the headrest cushion. I used it in my office wearing it for 2 hours straight without any sign of discomfort. Yes you will feel the headphones being there but it wont cause any kind of annoyance. The touch controls work really well and the call voice is also crystal clear.Sound Quality- A class, best in the market. Obviously you wont get the quality if you are listening to music on plain youtube. I use apple music , with lossless audio. For more high res audio you would need an external hardware and that is expected. The smart control app is a game changer, you can perfectly tune it to your exact preference.Battery backup - in the whole week i had charged it only once to 100 % and at the time of writing this review it is at 60%..i guess that should be enough.All in all if you are looking to invest in a premium headphone , i would 100% suggest it to you.Read more; Got this nifty gadget in the Great Indian Festival sale.

So because of this when i got these momenum 4, i was worried because i didn't liked the sound at all. They are so warm and bass heavy for me (initially) i almost thought of returning them. Luckily Sennheiser have an app that allows you to shape the sound the way you like, so i changed the EQ as my liking. I have attached the screenshot of my EQ as well, please don't judge me, keep this in mind i have habbit of listening to a studio grade mixing headphones 🎧 and they are crisp in detail so with this eq i am trying to match my audio experience for the momentum as per my previous headphones. In general what i am trying to say is that this EQ feature alone itself is the most important feature for any user. If you like their sound out of the box keep it that way, you don't, try tweaking those eq bars as per your liking..I have one more thing to share today. They get uncomfortable after 2 hours of usage, they get alot sweat and the clamping force starts hurting you. Which i beleive is fair because you shouldn't even use them for that long in one session. It's not recommended at all..Another thing that i would like to share is their battery life (mamamiya) it's amazing, with one full charge and extreme usage, they can last 3 days, with normal usage they can last a week. They really have great battery, trust me..Anyways I'll keep you posted, stay tuned..25th feb, 2025.So i went to a mall yesterday and i saw sony XM-5, my instant thought was that they have bigger ear cups, hence they are more comfortable. But listen, they don't sound as good as momentum 4, it's been 3 months now since I'm using these, I'm very happy with sound and battery, but I'm not happy with the comfort. Ever since I've tried sony xm-5, I've been thinking about their comfort. Don't get me wrong, these momentum 4 are good in comfort but only for an hour or 2, sony felt like you can wear them all day. Also sony are much lighter in weight.Read more; I'm a hobbyist beat maker and i work full time as a software Engineer, writting this review on 15 oct, will update further by date, it has been only two days of me using them so I'll update this review as we go.Stay TunedSIMRAN Banwait.Update - 25th Oct, 2024.It has been more than a week now, they are good and i mean it, i am personally use to listening music on Audio technica ath-m50x which are made for mixing, I've been listening to them from last two years, hence i had developed the habbit of a listening to low bass since mixing headphones are balanced and they are a little low in bass.

I am not sure if it was thru the distributor or seller that I received it defected as i was getting a lot of issues with the left ANC not working at all as the right side and also felt the music quality was an issue. I had got assistance from online sonova team help wherein i shipped my product to service center in delhi and received a brand new replaced product.Thats when listening to the true music clarity with proper ANC made me feel this is a worth buy and happy with the product.Very important feature is the music clarity a class with a good equaliser option for manual adjustments thru the app.Craziest of all is the DAMN BATTERY LIFE never seems to need charging like hardly once or twice a week max to charge depending how many hours of usage. Its crazy to have that feeling what a good battery life with just an hr max 2 for full charge.Anc works very well yes Sony must be better a notch higher but happy with the perfect price range.In the past i have purchased Dr Dre studio, Sony wf1000xm4 and now had to test Sennheiser.Happy to have purchased this Sennheiser.Read more; To start the review i had received the product with a defect.

Si possono anche usare cablate con il cavo in dotazione e offrono una custodia per portarle in giro. Il timbro risulta improntato sui bassi, ma senza esagerare; colpisce come i suoni degli strumenti musicali, le voci si riescano a distinguere in maniera cristallina quasi come se i musicisti stessero suonando vicino a te.1)Vengono spesso paragonate alle Sony XM5 come fascia di prezzo, in realtà l'unica cosa che le XM5 hanno di superiore è la cancellazione del rumore; ma questo non significa che le MOMENTUM non abbiano una buona cancellazione del rumore, anzi è più che sufficiente per quello che può essere un uso giornaliero moderato.2)Il prezzo può essere considerato da molti elevato, però la firma di Sennheiser giustifica l'alta qualità di queste cuffie; l'uso bluetooth di queste non mi ha fatto notare interferenze, rumore e fastidi a livello della qualità audio. Oggettivamente il prezzo >200-250 è giustificato.3)L'app per telefono offre diverse configurazioni e modalità di personalizzazione, sebbene esistano cuffie per audiofili sicuramente migliori, mi sento di dire che a questo prezzo valgono veramente la pena.4)I comandi touch sono davvero comodi e precisi, consentono di passare da modalità ambiente che ti fa sentire all'esterno e alla classica modalità delle cuffie.Ho letto che molti le hanno restituite, giusto perché la musica è di tutti, ma non per tutti.Read more; Le Cuffie Sennheiser MOMENTUM 4 Wireless sono veramente ottime per coloro che cercano una qualità audio ottima, insieme a tanta autonomia.

Le mie cuffie sono arrivate con il firmware 2.13.35.-- Aggiornamento 13/04/2025 --L'app mi ha notificato la disponibilità del nuovo firmware 2.13.42 che dovrebbe (così dice Sennheiser) risolvere tutti i problemi di connessione menzionati dagli altri utentiRead more; Fantastiche.Prese in sostituzione di cuffie di altro marchio nello stesso range di prezzo di cui ho fatto il reso in quanto estremamente deluso.Suono fantastico sin da subito sia su PC (collegate tramite adattatore BTD-600 codec aptx) sia su smartphone.Cancellazione del rumore per il mio utilizzo più che sufficiente ma come dicono tutte le recensioni non così potente come altri competitor.Batteria infinita.App semplice da usare e molto utile, consiglio (e se cercate non sono il solo) di ridurre a -6db il settaggio dei 63Hz nell'equalizzatore dato che ho trovato i bassi di queste cuffie molto presenti (ma è questione di gusti).Non ho mai riscontrato il problema riportato nelle altre recensioni delle frequenti disconnessioni forse perché collegato tramite BTD-600.

I bought them for $270, and now I see you can get them $20 less. I made the purchase, despite the negative reviews posted on Amazon simply because I have learned that reviews don't tell the whole story. Such as often times when it comes to Bluetooth devices, there will be a new firware/update that will need to be done, depending on how old the product is. In my case, that was the case. The firmware update was easy, took maybe a minute or two, and I was off and running. I have owned, and sold several headsets, from JBL, Beats, SkullCandy, Sony and yes, Bose. Now, for me, and how I like my music to sound, the Sennheiser 4s are by far the best sounding Bluetooth headphone to grace my melon. Mids, highs and lows work amazingly well. Wind and string instruments sound crisp, and suppurb! The lows/bass work harmoniously with the above mentioned. The Sennheiser equalizer is easy to use, and gets the job done. Touch controls: they take getting used to, but, once you adapt, it works great. Yes, at times you may pause music when touching the right ear cup, but again, you will adapt and recover. Comfort. These cans are extremely comfortable.  Even for my large head. Ear cushions are comfy, as is the head cushion. Could it use more cushion? Maybe if you wear them for 8 hrs straight. Weight. Yes, they way a tad bit more than the competition, but, that is to be expected as the battery is slightly larger...hence why you can get up to 60hrs of life on these bad boys! The cans don't feel cheap, they feel solid. And that is something I can appreciate. Are these cans perfect? They are as close to perfect that you will get (IMHO) on Bluetooth headsets. Are there better cans out there? Sure, If you go wired, and spend a few hundred more, then yes. Even Sennheiser wired headsets (depending what model you get) are better, but that's because they are wired. Of course they will sound better.One thing I didn't discuss is noise canceling. They get the job done in fine fashion. I have tried the Sony 5s, and they are slightly better than the Senn 4s. I have made several phones calls, FaceTime calls and the voice activation works wonderfully! I am 7000+ miles away from home, and not one complaint on how I sound, or, how the other end sounds. Lastly, battery life. It claims you can get 60hrs of life once fully charged. That is a fact, as I have tested that claim and  59+ hours the first charge, not quite there for the second charge.  Mind you, it will lose an hour or two depending on what you have activated.Accessories.  Well, you can listen to these cans wired, especially if you run out of charge. You will need a dongle (I purchased one from Amazon) and they sound great. It will sound different,  and you may need to adjust you equalizer.  The case the cans come with is a solid, good quality case with charging type C cable, 3.5 wired jack, and an airplane adaptor to plug your cable into so you can listen to  movies or music that the plane is playing.  And it all is neatly stored within the case.Final thoughts:I honestly feel that alot of the issues that some people reviewed on Amazon is these headsets  have ""buggy"" issues, or connectivity issues. Perhaps some just don't know how to do firmware updates, the phone they are using is dated? Not sure, all I know is mine cans fired right up, and I did the update straight away. These cans have Bluetooth 5.2, so it should be able to connect to any device that's out there currently. Yes, touch panel does take some getting used to. Much like driving a truck, then driving a sport car. It may take a moment to get familiar with the vehicle,  but once you do, it's a piece of cake.I decided to take a chance, I did my research outside of Amazon reviews, and watched the pros on YouTube, and that's how I ended up buying these. Big risk considering I am a world away. Give em a try, you can always return them if they aren't for you.Read more; I just received these Sennheiser Momentum 4 cans about 7 days ago.

Super handy to be connected to 2 devices at once as I use these for work between laptop and phone but these also are great for the gym with the noise cancellation to block out the music there. Very minimal movement when working out which is great as this was one of my concerns before purchasing.So comfortable I forget I'm wearing them, for anyone prone to migranes like me these aren't likely to cause one.Read more; These are really great headphone, highly recommend these.

Even after replacing the battery, the M2 still doesn’t work wirelessly.Initially, I thought there wasn’t much difference between the M3 and the Momentum 4 (M4) in terms of sound quality, as both have the same 42mm driver. However, after switching the Bluetooth codec to aptX Adaptive, which supports high bitrate, I noticed a significant improvement in sound quality while listening to music on YouTube. Despite YouTube not being the best audio source, the sound became clearer with resonant bass. Although I’m not an expert, I really enjoy the sound, making the M4 a worthwhile upgrade from the M3.The M4 boasts a 60-hour battery life, a touchpad, increased comfort, significantly improved Active Noise Cancellation (ANC), and support for aptX Adaptive, which is comparable to Sony’s LDAC codec. On the other hand, my Sony WH-1000XM3 and XM4 support LDAC but don’t deliver the same high-quality sound. We appreciate Sony for its ANC and comfort, but not for its sound quality. In our opinion, the Bose QuietComfort 35 and the new QuietComfort models offer better sound quality than Sony, though they lack the bass presence of the M3 and M4. If we were to consider another pair of headphones, we would likely choose the Bose QC Ultra due to its support for aptX Adaptive.Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference. I prefer Sennheiser for its sound quality, while my wife prefers Bose for its comfort and superior ANC. It’s fortunate that we don’t prefer the same headphones!Read more; I currently own the Sennheiser Momentum 3 (M3) headphones, but I need an additional pair to replace my old, reliable Momentum 2 (M2), which unfortunately has a battery issue.

I prefer Sennheiser for its sound quality, while my wife prefers Bose for its comfort and superior ANC. It’s fortunate that we don’t prefer the same headphones!",headphones,3

These headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.Let's start with the build quality. Imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. They weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. Yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.Now, I'm a reasonable person. Accidents happen. So, I contacted NOISE support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. What I got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. They dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).So, here I am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. The audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. My advice? Steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. Unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.For those seeking a more constructive alternative:Do your research! Read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.Prioritize build quality. Look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.Understand the warranty terms thoroughly. Don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.Remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. Choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.Read more; I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS.

From the moment I received the product, it has been nothing but a headache. The headphones are completely defective – the Bluetooth feature does not work at all. I tried connecting them to multiple phones, including different brands and models, but the headphones simply refuse to pair. It’s clear that the product is faulty, and no amount of troubleshooting has made a difference.When I reached out to the seller for assistance, their response was utterly unhelpful. They provided no useful solutions or support, and it felt like they were just brushing me off. I then tried to initiate a return and refund through Amazon, only to find out that it’s not possible. How is this even acceptable? I paid for a product that doesn’t function as advertised, and now I’m stuck with it. It’s incredibly frustrating to feel like I’ve been scammed out of my money.To make matters worse, Amazon’s customer service was no help either. They were unable to resolve the issue and offered no real solution. It’s shocking that a platform as large as Amazon would allow such poor-quality products to be sold and then fail to support customers when things go wrong. The entire experience has left me feeling cheated and helpless.This purchase has been a total waste of time and money. The headphones are useless, the seller is unresponsive, and Amazon’s customer service is ineffective. I regret ever buying this product and will definitely think twice before making another purchase on Amazon. The lack of accountability from both the seller and Amazon is unacceptable.I would strongly advise others to avoid this seller and be cautious when shopping on Amazon. There’s no guarantee that you’ll receive a functional product, and if something goes wrong, you might be left with no recourse. Save yourself the frustration and shop elsewhere. This experience has been a complete disaster, and I will never recommend this seller or rely on Amazon for a resolution again.Read more; I am beyond disappointed with my recent purchase of wireless Bluetooth headphones from Amazon.

Build quality: (4.5/5) it's plastic is pretty good, I have got the black variant, so it's quite prone to scratches but I have also had a rough usage from the past 6 months so no complaints, the cushions (ear padding) is also great, no sweating over long usage or irritation. The padding on the head is also comfortable.2. Anc:(4/5) the anc isn't best but good in the segment. It can cut off the fan noise and other noises too.3. Transparency:(3/5) it's pretty basic, but makes the sound feel like it's on high frequency which sometimes can be irritating.4. Sound:(5/5) the sound is amazing, the app has 22 different presets and you can choose according to your likes. The base it also good. If you are a gamer then there is a little latency but not too much. If you are using aux then the latency I just 0. And the sound on aux is pretty standard and flat.(I would prefer music on blutooth)Battery: (5/5) the battery life on it is just amazing, I use for like 5-7 hours a day and charge it once in a week. And it charges fast too.Few extras: I have received 2 updates from the last 6 months and I have felt that the dual connection feature has been more optimized than before.Also the app ui is user friendly and goodIt also sometimes doesn't connect automatically when I turn it on but not a big deal.Overall:(4.5/5) I got it for the price of 3.8k and it's a amazing deal for the price.Read more; I have been using it since the last 6 months, and I would say that it's worth every penny I have spent on it, the breakdown of the rating is as follows:1.

Perfect Bluetooth connectivity with 2 devices. Switch between the audios is flawless. It allows me to switch between listening to music from mobile and connect to office calls. Sturdy design which looks premium. It has button controlls instead of touch, personally I like it this way as it won't have any accidental change of settings. Comfortable wear with soft padding. Decent bass. Soundcore app works fine as well. Charges quite fastCons: I don't think ANC is that effective as I don't feel any noticable difference between ANC-Normal-transparency mode. Sounds better in normal mode than in ANC. Supports Hi-Res audio via auxiliary cable, but didn't notice any significant difference(may be because I am not that big an audiophile). No carry pouch is provided, so need to be careful.Overall, it is a great headset with really good sound quality that does justice to it's price point.Read more; Pros: Has great low and mids.

Secondly the battery life is amazing, on a single charge I use this for like 40-45 Hrs and it still doesn't stop! Sound quality is decent in these but it's not cheap at all, tho i would say the durability is below average in these, but it's totally fine for an average user. Most importantly the mic is trash, i bought one of these in 2021 which broke in 2024 so I bought it again in 2024 and in both of the models, the mics did not work and that's the only drawback of this Headphone.Read more; The best headphones in this budget, I'm 6'3 and I have a big skull and ears but these fit perfectly on my head and are very comfortable!

Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is almost fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). It is average in terms of gaming. If you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. You can buy this headphone for games like Minecraft. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.Thank you for reading. Just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.Read more; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition. Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is almost fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). It is average in terms of gaming. If you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. You can buy this headphone for games like Minecraft. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.Thank you for reading. Just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.; Surprisingly exceeded my expectations. Although I am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. There is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. Which is a pity, but ah well. Can't have it all, can ya?Best bluetooth headphones at 799 for sound AND mic quality. And let's not forget comfort. Headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.Although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.Even though I have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  Even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. So if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these. But if you don't mind going for EARPHONES, then there are many better options available in terms of sound quality.Read more; Surprisingly exceeded my expectations.

The mic is good, i tested the mic on discord and calls...It's pretty well. Battery is superb as it's been two days since I they were 100% and now when am writing this review.....it's still at 90%. Sound Quality is good. Gaming is bit of controversial as some might find it good but lemme tell u one thing that the latency is always not good at this price point but these are good for any story mode games and ok ok for competitive games.Hope it helps☺️Btw I got them for 800 rs.Read more; These headphones are good for the price but there is only one major problem that is comfort...I mean that you will not be able to wear them for long sessions otherwise it's overall a banger considering it's price.

The vocals are clear if you increase your volume to 50% + but it does have a con will share in a moment- if you are under 20 age with small to medium head then it is suitable for you :)- yes the SD card works very well just make sure your SD card is clean and only has .mp3 files.-Gamers you can go for it if you don't play sports! Then go for it, Emin gaming mode it has very minimal latency which unfortunately I can't count but yeah I play a lot of games so it is working very well, you can play in 80% volume no leakage :) depends on the game also! The aux cable and gaming mode both works equally same and is really good :)- Voice call quality is 8/10 :)CONS:-if you have bigger head don't buy it, it will fit your head easily but then the cushions will start hurting in 3-4 hours so yeah like I have medium to bigger head so it hurts a bit after some hours-Cushions doesn't absorb any sweat!- it has sound leakage issue so basically above 60% or above 50% the sound comes out! Well it depends on what you are listening if it's phonk then stay low at 40-50% trust me it still sounds good! If you are listening to simple lofi songs then go for 60% + so yeah!- the ENC is a joke here 😂- in gaming the sounds of gunshots are a bit too loud so yeahSo yeah a 4 day review and yes it is worth it and value for money product also a year warranty is also there haha!Will update after some weeks of usage :)Edit : so after months of usage it's still like when I bought ❤️ perfect durable looks are still good also the sound quality at this price range is perfect also every method works and connectivity is fast, for me using everyday 3-6 hrs works easily for 10 days! You don't even need to turn on gaming mode coz the normal mode is just so good! Barely any latency, the enc is clickbait I don't think it works but honestly for me when I wear it and play music or meeting calls and other multimedia at at least 50-60 volume : I can't hear noise at all barely audible so that's good!

Amazon will only take responsibility if the product is damaged upon delivery. If the product turns out to be defective or has other issues, Amazon won't help—you'll have to claim the warranty through boAt's service center.And before you rely on that, I suggest you check out how boAt's service actually is—just search on YouTube. Also, watch the video I’ve shared.I bought these headphones myself and received a defective product. When I plugged in the AUX cable and played games, my teammates kept hearing an irritating noise. I tested it on both iPad and Android, plus six other devices—the issue was the same every time.When I contacted Amazon, they said the product wasn’t damaged, so I should reach out to boAt. BoAt picked up my product, kept it for 13 days, and then sent the same unit back saying there was no issue with it. So, I didn’t even get a replacement.Read more; Guys, before buying these headphones, make sure to carefully read the return/replacement terms and conditions.

The bluetooth connectivity is great and fast. The wire are of good quality. The mic quality is good too not that clear but can be used for regular basis or for daily callings.Overall the product is comfortable, a great fit and has a premium look. The audio is Good ( only when connected with bluetooth). A value for money product for sure.Read more; The bass and sound is really clear and good even with full volume when connected with bluetooth but the AUX mode proved very low quality sound/ music it's more like you're listening in low volume even when the volume is 100%.The charging is not that fast but it needs max 1-1.5 hours to fully charge.

The cushion quality is also very comfortable.The Bluetooth connection is also good and considerably fast.Played COD(without aux) and its truely 40ms latency. So kudos in that area too.Love itDrawbacks -little problem with the aux wire. The wired connection is okay.Would face some problem when not wearing on your head i.e keeping them on your neck as looking down is not possible.

I was frustrated after the headband breaking again and again I took matter in my own hands and opened the headphones and applied aerolite on the headband with some support but the headband still bro even after applying aerolite. I have never thought that the boat headphones would have this bad quality. Even if they import from China they should at least give good quality for the price they are charging for the product. What is the point of advertising themselves is Indian brand when the import from China and have the worst quality of then all.  All their money is wasted on advertisement by the celebrities. I am very dissatisfied with the quality of headphones and would never consider buying any headphones or product from boat.

The sound quality is excellent, with rich bass and clear highs, which is perfect for music, movies, and even gaming. The BEAST mode with 40ms low latency is a great touch, making gaming feel smooth and immersive without any lag.Battery life is another highlight – it lasts up to 40 hours, so I’ve been able to use them for days without charging. The adaptive fit is comfortable too, even for long listening sessions, and the headphones feel lightweight yet sturdy.Another great feature is the environmental noise cancelling , which makes calls crystal clear by reducing background noise. I’ve also found the voice assistant activation really convenient for multitasking. Overall, these headphones deliver amazing value for money. If you’re looking for a budget-friendly, high-quality pair of Bluetooth headphones, I’d highly recommend the boAt Rockerz 430!Read more; I’ve been using the boAt Rockerz 430 for about a week now, and I’m honestly pretty impressed.

Build quality: (4.5/5) it's plastic is pretty good, I have got the black variant, so it's quite prone to scratches but I have also had a rough usage from the past 6 months so no complaints, the cushions (ear padding) is also great, no sweating over long usage or irritation. The padding on the head is also comfortable.2. Anc:(4/5) the anc isn't best but good in the segment. It can cut off the fan noise and other noises too.3. Transparency:(3/5) it's pretty basic, but makes the sound feel like it's on high frequency which sometimes can be irritating.4. Sound:(5/5) the sound is amazing, the app has 22 different presets and you can choose according to your likes. The base it also good. If you are a gamer then there is a little latency but not too much. If you are using aux then the latency I just 0. And the sound on aux is pretty standard and flat.(I would prefer music on blutooth)Battery: (5/5) the battery life on it is just amazing, I use for like 5-7 hours a day and charge it once in a week. And it charges fast too.Few extras: I have received 2 updates from the last 6 months and I have felt that the dual connection feature has been more optimized than before.Also the app ui is user friendly and goodIt also sometimes doesn't connect automatically when I turn it on but not a big deal.Overall:(4.5/5) I got it for the price of 3.8k and it's a amazing deal for the price.Read more; I have been using it since the last 6 months, and I would say that it's worth every penny I have spent on it, the breakdown of the rating is as follows:1.

Perfect Bluetooth connectivity with 2 devices. Switch between the audios is flawless. It allows me to switch between listening to music from mobile and connect to office calls. Sturdy design which looks premium. It has button controlls instead of touch, personally I like it this way as it won't have any accidental change of settings. Comfortable wear with soft padding. Decent bass. Soundcore app works fine as well. Charges quite fastCons: I don't think ANC is that effective as I don't feel any noticable difference between ANC-Normal-transparency mode. Sounds better in normal mode than in ANC. Supports Hi-Res audio via auxiliary cable, but didn't notice any significant difference(may be because I am not that big an audiophile). No carry pouch is provided, so need to be careful.Overall, it is a great headset with really good sound quality that does justice to it's price point.Read more; Pros: Has great low and mids.

"OnePlus Bullets Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Z2 Earphones with Mic, Bombastic Bass, 12.4 mm Drivers, 10 Mins Charge, 20 Hrs Music, 30 Hrs Battery Life, IP55 Dust & Water Resistant (Beam Blue)","₹1,599",4.1,B09TVV1TXL,https://www.amazon.in/Bluetooth-Wireless-Earphones-Bombastic-Launched/dp/B09TVV1TXL/ref=sr_1_52?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.IqBQXzynRcvAoMnVaqFIAXtRurKprBoVq9ZkW3f7u8plCL_gKV8GdZLkY55jRvf9Ray6E-h_Oao4Xss-5JAVLZI3hbkAv-FlkViKxPTrk_qbz9laWyAZsA2qj6AQgVuprLw9U0TOVFiDPmMrUJM8xY-utYP2hA60tNJ7m5F5qGGs9NX7uq2_gOJ0iKFXJv3XBlag6uQC3dz29neYHlq_ICo4P-HFocnrZXmbz092bYw.IIGIOMuCDLFQbJmX3CfpFjpMBokBEIDpf687aTDtc0Y&dib_tag=se&keywords=headphones&qid=1747130623&sr=8-52,"If you're on the lookout for a solid pair of wireless earphones, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 might just catch your eye. I've been using them for a while, and here's my honest take on what they have to offer.Connectivity & Ease of Use:Let’s start with one of the essentials—connectivity. The OnePlus Bullets Z2 nails it with seamless Bluetooth connectivity that just works. Pairing them with my phone was as simple as it gets, and once connected, they stay that way without any annoying drops. The button placement on the neckband is intuitive, and after a day or two of use, I could easily control playback without needing to glance down, thanks to muscle memory. It’s the kind of convenience you don’t realize you need until you have it.Sound Quality - Balanced Yet Personal:Now, onto the sound quality. As someone who values a balanced sound signature, I found the Z2 to be a great match for my taste. Whether I'm listening to some mellow jazz, electronic beats, or even rock, the sound remains well-rounded and crisp. The highs, mids, and lows don't overpower each other, making it perfect for those who don't want their ears blasted with bass or overwhelmed by treble.That said, sound quality is a subjective experience, and preferences can vary widely. If you're a bass head looking for those earth-shaking lows, you might find these a tad restrained. But if, like me, you appreciate a balanced output across genres, these will hit the right notes for you.Battery Life & Quick Charging - A Week of Peace:Battery life is another highlight. With moderate use—think about 1-2 hours daily—you can stretch a single charge to last an entire week. Even if you’re a heavy listener, using them for 6-8 hours straight, they can hold up for around 2-3 days before needing a recharge. And the quick charge feature is a lifesaver—just 10 minutes of charging gets you 2-4 hours of extra playtime, which is perfect for those “oops, I forgot to charge them” moments.Gaming & Low Latency - Smooth Experience:I spend a fair bit of time playing games like BGMI, and the low latency mode on the Bullets Z2 makes a noticeable difference. There's minimal lag between the visuals and the audio, which makes for a much more immersive gaming experience. It's not just about the sound being clear; it's also about it being on time, and these earphones deliver that pretty well.Comfort & Passive Noise Isolation:Comfort is key when it comes to neckbands, and the Z2 doesn’t disappoint. They come with multiple earbud sizes, so you can pick the one that fits snugly for you. While there’s no active noise cancellation (ANC) here, you can achieve a decent level of passive noise isolation by choosing the right ear tips. This makes a noticeable difference in cutting out background noise during commutes or at the office.App Experience & Annoying Blinking Light:Now, onto a couple of quirks. The Bullets Z2 uses the HeyMelody app, which offers additional features like custom sound settings. However, my unit just wouldn’t connect with the app, which was a bummer. So, any fancy tweaks you could make through the app were out of my reach, and I had to rely solely on the default Bluetooth pairing. While everything worked smoothly once connected, I feel like I missed out on some customization options that might have enhanced my experience.Another thing that bugged me was the small white light that blinks when the neckband is connected to a device. It might not seem like a big deal, but if you’re using the earphones in a dark room or while lying down, that blinking light can be pretty distracting. Plus, it probably drains the battery a bit, albeit a small amount. A simple option to turn this off in the app would’ve been a nice touch.Final Thoughts - A Solid Pick for Most, with Room for Improvement:Overall, the OnePlus Z2 delivers where it matters—good sound quality, reliable connectivity, and battery life that won’t have you constantly reaching for the charger. It’s not perfect, especially with the blinking light and app connectivity issues, but those are minor compared to the solid performance it offers. Plus, with the quick-charge feature and low-latency gaming experience, it’s hard not to appreciate the value you get.If you’re looking for a reliable neckband that blends style, comfort, and balanced audio, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 is definitely worth considering. It might not satisfy those who crave earth-shattering bass, but for most listeners, it's a worthy contender at its price point.Read more; If you're on the lookout for a solid pair of wireless earphones, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 might just catch your eye.

They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.The earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating.Pairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.You get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.As for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.If you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.That said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.They come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.The Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass.Read more; There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking.

The fit is good and the design is nice in my opinion, very slim and light weight. Despite the magnetic connection of the earbuds being the only way to power down the device this has not been an issue, they snap together and power down flawlessly. They are comfortable and the connection is the fastest I've ever seen and they connect to my S24 within a few seconds after separating the magnetic backs of the earbuds. Sound quality is decent, but the price and functionality has surpassed expectations as I've been using them for over 5 months and I've only had to charge them maybe once every other week for like 30 minutes.Read more; Bought these for the 2-3 hours a week I am at the gym and the battery life is good.

NOT A SINGLE CONCERN WAS FOUNDED TO BE TRUE.1.Mic is working absolutely fine. You can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. If you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. Now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). For all other purposes its perfect.2.I received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am I switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. It has been playing non stop. Its perfect. If you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. You don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). Battery life is sufficient. I haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. Anyway , by what I've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. Firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. Very comfortable. Its definitely over the ears and Completely covers them. Even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. Also , I dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , I've seen heavier gaming headphones.

The speakers are tightly held with the band and while I don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5.

I don't play games so I can't talk bout Latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. Now talking bout the wired mode. It Might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. The clarity is just perfect and No latency ofcourse. No need of battery in aux mode. Can keep using it even if the battery is dead. I Like this feature so much. For a student like me , its a charmer. No unnecessary breaks .

Ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.; Great Budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together. Great build quality. Great fit can put straight for 2 to 3 hours, after it might feel a bit discomfort, depends on person to person. Great battery, brand claims 40hr and i get too around 38 to 39hr in it which says its approved for long hours. Very good sound quality, if you are confused between two headphones in this budget and you like BASS more, then pick this one it has great bass. So everything is good, but there is one major, very big problem which is kinda aceeptable for someone and not for a lot of pepole. The problem is Sound leakage, if you listen even above 50% vol or for some songs even at 30% vol, the sound starts to get outside earphone. your experience won't get bad for urself but the outsiders could also hear it which is why its not good to use it in public. if u go on 90% volume, rather than a headphone it becomes a speaker, u won't face any problem in ears, but voice outside will come loud easily hearable. It means brand gave everything, but could not block the speakers towards the outer end meaning voice gets outside easilyRead more; Great Budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together.

I got it for a nice deal (approx. Rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). I was reviewing multiple headphones under the Rs. 5k range. My first choice was the Sony CH-520, but I did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and I didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under Rs. 5k). The other options were Boat, Zebronics (a different set), Hammer and a variety of other ones.Among them I did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. I wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. It was available at a reasonable price and the RGB lights impressed me. So I ordered them.PROS:- Sounds good! I'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. No issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. The bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- Sturdy. The headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. While laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. I have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. They are still in good shape- RGB. The lights are definitely funky. They look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- Battery. Applaudable battery without hesitation. I use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.CONS:- Mic. I've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. My peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what I just said- Huge cushions and ear muffs! The size of the muffs are simply too big. When traveling with the headphones on in buses, I like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. But this is simply not possibly with these headphones. The muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. When I try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. So I'm forced to sit rigid for a while- Terrible button placement. The power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. This makes it very hard to use the controls. I have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. It's so ridiculous that I stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- Bad USB-C connection slot. The USB-C connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other USB-C wires because it has a narrow deep opening. So my phone's USB-C charger doesn't fit in it. Only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. This means I always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackOverall decent pair. In my previous (edited now) review, I mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. After several days I realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. So, I have edited my review and updated the ratingCheers!Read more; 3.5/5I have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. I got it for a nice deal (approx.

This was a rather impulsive purchase as i wanted a earbud for listening to music .As i am not a audiophile i just went with a good looking earbud . But to my surprise these are decent for listening to music and even playing games as they can be used with low latency mode.The sound quality is decent but dont expect a basy sound from the buds they can get very loud and does a good job for paasive noise cancellation.I also liked the battery performance as they can last a really long time i have not been able to kill the buds even while travellingCons :In ear feel of the buds in not great and can get annoying after a couple of hoursThere aren't much but if we nitpick the connectivity has droped on its own a couple of time nothing much if it as it doesn't happen often.The case is not that durable or reassuring as some other buds in the price range.Read more; A fine purchase on my end with reliable battery life , elegant or even stylish look , a decent sound quality and volume levels .I have used these buds as my daily listening device for a long time .

I use this for 2 to 2.5 day may be 6-7 hours a day.. it's comes with a 3.5mm jack- so you can use it even if you runs out of battery. Cushions could have been softer and sweat absorbing- if using in an air conditioned room, this isn't a prob.Felt this was little heavier compared to the one I used earlier - Sennihiser and Sony headphones I used were a little expensive.Problem comes if you travel with this-bulk it is.I prefer a foldable over-the head. Headbands are adjustable but if you change them frequently plastic will have a wear and tear. Fix one position and don't change it frequently.Read more; V good.. sound it reproduce is super.. unlike in-ears no much pain.

The sponge covering torn of completely after 1 year of usage and one side of the headphone broke while taking them  off my head, Really like the audio quality. One more thing I like to include is the charging port, it's built very loosely, you have to bend the whole cable and keep it tight near the port to charge.Pros: Audio quality is just awesome, u can use these headphones while listening to music ans gaming(with aux cable) too.It's is really comfortable near the ears and ear doesn't hurts after 5-6hrs of continuous usage.Battery life is also good I used to charge once in 4-6days and mostly used bluetooth.I did paired(Bluetooth only) it with my laptop and mobile at same time but headphones only process one device sound at a time so I had to mute other time to time to shift onto devices. So u have to manage this thing.It pairs with device easily without any issue or without taking much time. The aux cable is good too not too tight or too loose just perfect.Head adjustment mechanism is kinda funny because the headphones moves side to side faster when u take headphones out of adjustment idk why, could be less friction.While gaming with aux cable on u can get 0 latency(no sound delay) and can differentiate between lefts and rights and it's really helpful.I don't know the weight of headphones but they feels light on head so u can play games or watch movies without headacheCons: Build quality, full plastic body with only metal strip on head adjustment band and the plastic quality is ok ok...(cuz it broke ;-;)Charging port is loosely fitted so you have to sacrifice your cable life spanCushion are comfy but the skin or we say covering starts to fall off after some time and the headphones looks like dog water.High latency in Bluetooth mode making it use aux cable while gaming only and if u dont have aux cable port in your device so just quit these headphones and look for something else.Looks too big on head so won't recommend for gym, walk usage.You came across whole review so here's ur cookie 🍪!Read more; Personal Feedback: I didn't like the build quality at all.

It's not for audiophiles, but for casual music listening and gaming, it’s great.; The boAt Rockerz line is boAt's super cheap lineup for budget buyers. This will likely be many people's first foray into the world of wireless headphones, and is likely to turn many people off by its many compromises. It might be worth buying your grandma as a gift, but is  not something I'd ever recommend buying for your own use.1. Sound Quality - awful. Honestly, the boAt Rockerz 450 does little more than bring your phone's audio loser to your ears. It isn't any significant improvement over your phone's speaker, and might actually be an active downgrade from your computer's speakers. Most audio sounds tinny, there's little to no bass, and absolutely zero noise cancellation. On or off, you can and will hear the outside world. Those who carry wireless headphones to tune out the outside world on walks or airplanes will be sorely disappointed. The soundstage is very small and shallow, and even non-audiophiles will notice the poor sound quality.2. Comfort - Horrendous. The boAt Rockerz 450 is a pain to wear, both literally and figuratively. The audio sounds horrible, and your ears will feel horrible too after an hour of use, maybe less. The good battery life means nothing if you cant use these headphones for more than 45 minutes at a time. After removing these headphones, your ears will hurt for a long while, and you'll feel like never wearing these again. The cans are very small, even for on-ear headphones, and people with spectacles or large heads will be even worse off. The frame doesn't extend very far, and also slips down quite easily.3. Build Quality - In a word - bad. See a pattern here? The headphones reflect their low price point, and are  entirely made of cheap plastic. The plastic also doesn't flex much, and the headphones seem very easy to break by accident. It's worth noting that the cups don't extend much. If you're one of those guys who like to leave their headphones dangling around their neck when not in use, you'll find yourself unable to lower your head without your headphones biting into your jaw. Finally, the cups absorb a lot of sweat. You'l find yourself wanting to wash the cups and frustrated that you can't. It's really gross.5. Mic - Absolutely trash tier. You won't even be able to use the mic for how bad it is. I honestly forgot these headphones even had a mic because it's so soft and picks up so much background noise. Callers will not be able to hear you clearly and will keep urging you to switch back to your phone, and you can forget about trying to use these with your PC for voice chat or conference calls. Don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a mic with this headset - the mic only exists on paper. It's really not worth using.4. Final words - Just, don't. Spend a bit more, get a decent pair of wireless headphones. The headset doesn't even connect properly half the time, and when it does, you'll wish it didn't. Save  up some money, work at McDonalds, and treat yourself to some good headphones. Anything, but not these ones.

I've been using them nonstop for workouts, commutes, and just relaxing. The connection is seamless, and the call quality is top-notch. Highly recommend! Five stars isn't enough – I'd give it ten stars if I could!; Lindo e bem alto o volume, só apertar um pouco na orelha, mas nada muito exagerado, e a bateria dura bastante, super recomendoRead more; Lindo e bem alto o volume, só apertar um pouco na orelha, mas nada muito exagerado, e a bateria dura bastante, super recomendoRead more; Lindo e bem alto o volume, só apertar um pouco na orelha, mas nada muito exagerado, e a bateria dura bastante, super recomendo; Great Sound, Good bass and noice cancellations is also great.

Apesar de o produto ter uma qualidade excepcional e oferecer um som magnífico, ele apresenta um problema recorrente: sempre se prende no meu cabelo. E quando digo que se prende, não são apenas alguns fios isolados; é uma parte considerável, porque há uma seção móvel nos fones que ergonomicamente acaba prendendo meu cabelo, causando dor, incômodo e até a perda de cabelos decorrente dessa situação.Read more; Minha avaliação é 4 estrelas.

These headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.Let's start with the build quality. Imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. They weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. Yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.Now, I'm a reasonable person. Accidents happen. So, I contacted NOISE support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. What I got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. They dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).So, here I am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. The audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. My advice? Steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. Unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.For those seeking a more constructive alternative:Do your research! Read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.Prioritize build quality. Look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.Understand the warranty terms thoroughly. Don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.Remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. Choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.Read more; I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS.

It was between this and the Bose QC45 for me. My primary headphones for 8 years now are the Audio Technica ATH-M50x which are a solid pair of wired neutral headphones, so I'll use those as a reference for audio quality.Short read: Why I picked this over the Bose QC45 - sounds marginally better overall (with loads of room in the low end for those who like heavy bass), equally comfortable, better battery life, better app/customisability, and also a bit more discreet. I don't want people knowing I'm carrying around pricey headphones so I'd rather have a pair of plain looking Sonys than a Bose pair that screams expensive. Also, the carrying case is actually pretty great and protects these well. I wear these headphones everywhere, even at the gym.- Amazing battery: LDAC + DSEE Extreme on gives me a full week of use with 2-3 hours of use per day, at around 60-70% volume. Nice to not have to worry about charging these all the time (uses USB-C).- Audio: Super weird out of the box- very boomy and muddy low-mids. I EQd this and it went from sounding like an average set to an incredible one. It's just a bit bizarre to me that they'd hamstring this pair so severely out of the box when they're capable of so much more.It has great frequency response and articulation, you'll hear tons of detail once it is set up right, so credit to the drivers they're using. I'm including an EQ preset for your reference, which should be good for blues, jazz, folk, country, and classical (anything with nice vocals). Compared to the M50x, they have much better bass so anyone into EDM will like this set as well.- Comfort: They're wonderfully comfortable. Super light, doesn't clamp your head or ears, and you can wear them for hours. The cushions are soft and don't hurt your ears. Orders of magnitude more comfortable than my M50x, and easily the best other than the Bose QC line. You'll forget you're wearing them, they're that neat.- ANC: They completely block out low hums and noises coming from fans, ACs, and in-flight rumble, even with no music playing. Makes sense since they seem to be designed primarily as travel/commute headphones. Voices and other sounds can still kinda be heard but are drowned out if you're listening to music at anything above 30-40% volume. I don't think it's meant to block out these sounds, so I'm not particular about it. I can sit through an entire flight and hear nothing, which by itself is completely worth it to me.- Multipoint: works as advertised, I was able to use it fine with my Samsung Galaxy phone and Macbook pro upon testing. I don't use this feature though since I prefer LDAC and that is only possible with multi-point off. However if MP is useful for you, know that it works pretty seamlessly.Conclusion: If you can afford these headphones, I would easily recommend them to you. They sound genuinely amazing for a wireless closed back pair, are very customisable, comfortable, and the battery lasts for days, literally. The ANC is best-in-class and made for frequent travelers. It's one of those things that will last you years and years of use if you look after them. They also go on sale quite frequently, so wait for one before you buy (I got it for INR ~15,500). It's rare that I spend this much on a luxury item and still consider it a bargain.

I EQd this and it went from sounding like an average set to an incredible one. It's just a bit bizarre to me that they'd hamstring this pair so severely out of the box when they're capable of so much more.It has great frequency response and articulation, you'll hear tons of detail once it is set up right, so credit to the drivers they're using. I'm including an EQ preset for your reference, which should be good for blues, jazz, folk, country, and classical (anything with nice vocals). Compared to the M50x, they have much better bass so anyone into EDM will like this set as well.- Comfort: They're wonderfully comfortable. Super light, doesn't clamp your head or ears, and you can wear them for hours. The cushions are soft and don't hurt your ears. Orders of magnitude more comfortable than my M50x, and easily the best other than the Bose QC line. You'll forget you're wearing them, they're that neat.- ANC: They completely block out low hums and noises coming from fans, ACs, and in-flight rumble, even with no music playing. Makes sense since they seem to be designed primarily as travel/commute headphones. Voices and other sounds can still kinda be heard but are drowned out if you're listening to music at anything above 30-40% volume. I don't think it's meant to block out these sounds, so I'm not particular about it. I can sit through an entire flight and hear nothing, which by itself is completely worth it to me.- Multipoint: works as advertised, I was able to use it fine with my Samsung Galaxy phone and Macbook pro upon testing. I don't use this feature though since I prefer LDAC and that is only possible with multi-point off. However if MP is useful for you, know that it works pretty seamlessly.Conclusion: If you can afford these headphones, I would easily recommend them to you. They sound genuinely amazing for a wireless closed back pair, are very customisable, comfortable, and the battery lasts for days, literally. The ANC is best-in-class and made for frequent travelers. It's one of those things that will last you years and years of use if you look after them. They also go on sale quite frequently, so wait for one before you buy (I got it for INR ~15,500). It's rare that I spend this much on a luxury item and still consider it a bargain. Cheers.; I have been using these industry leading headphones by Sony, colour Midnight Blue, and trust me i find them worth every penny spent. Yes, i agree these headphones are highly expensive, some may say you can purchase Apple Airpods, Boss, Sennheiser, and other audio equipment options, but trust me nothing beats these bad boys.I am not a tech reviewer, but since being a musician, a music connoisseur myself and a huge fanatic of accessories such as headphones, earphones and smart gadgets, i can tell, these headphones are a revolution to the sound industry. I'll be quoting every pros and cons that i've personally come across and might help a few of you who decide to purchase this beauty.Pros:1. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): Let's talk about people who love listening to their music without any external interference while working, walking, running, working out, during a flight, or any other mode where they'd use them, ANC is a boon. Switch to ANC, you'll have the minimum of the minimum noise entering your ears. Only sounds close to you can reach at a very low level, else wise, you won't feel a thing in your ear. Be prepared for some bashing from your parents when they scream your name on top of their voices, and you've got that ANC kicked in.2. 3 Ambience Sound Control (ASC) ON: Apart from the ANC, there are two more features that these bad boys offer.  ASC when active gives you a chance to listen to your surroundings at a certain level where you can be aware of people speaking, birds chirping, children hauling in the park, and other sounds. This feature enables one to understand the surrounding noises and doesn't feel isolated.3. Ambience Sound Control (ASC) OFF: When ASC is disabled or switched off, you can listen to your surrounding voices in a much denser state, ie. much more clearly in comparison to when the ASC is enabled. This feature is much similar to the ASC ON, just a slight difference of pitch and volume of the surrounding entering your ears.4. Head Phones Connect by Sony: Let's talk about the main functioning unit of these headphones, the app provided by Sony under the name of Head Phones Connect. You can download it from the App store if you are an iPhone user just like me, as well as from the play store for android users.This app is highly functional as well as quite intact providing a list of various functions such as adaptive sound control which is highly recommended to lazy people just like me. Once all set up, the app detects your actions and locations frequently, and switches the headphones settings automatically.In addition, if you are a daily user of these headphones just like me, the app tracks your daily attributes such as at what certain volume do you like listening you music, which mode do you mostly use, which location do you travel, and then adjusts the headphones as per your choice.One feature which at first startled me a lot but i really got impressed by it which is the Speak-to-chat feature. It's always annoying to either pull your phone out of your pocket and pause the music or to just pull off your headsets every time you need to talk to someone. This feature enables your headphones to pause automatically the instant you start speaking, and shall remain pause for about 20 secs and resume on their own if they do not detect any speech.For better sound quality, the app detects the size and shape of your ear through these headphones. This enables the device to perform better with distinct users.5. Motion Gestures: The right ear piece of the headphones has all the motion gestures such as taps for music pause/play, attend a call, play next/previous song and remove the headsets and the song pauses. These controls are highly helpful and can be easily learnt through the guide book provided, hence i won't dive deeper into it.6. Number of devices that can be paired at once: These headphones provide an option of connecting two devices simultaneously. You can connect these headphones to almost every device that has a latest and updated version of bluetooth/NFC. Devices that i've paired them with are iPhone, macbook, hp laptop, and android phones.7. What's in the box: The box comes with an impressive in-shape carrying case to carry these bad boys where ever you go. Also they include a C-type data cable for charging, 3.5mm jack cable which is quite long (haven't measured it honestly, but it is as long as a regular data cable), and a dual port 3.5mm jack converter, which so far i haven't tested.8. Battery Life: Well i must say that i am quite impressed with the battery backup these headphones provide. This device completely charges within 3 hours and trust me with an ON/OFF mode of playing music regularly, the battery stays up till 4-5 days, which is i bet a highly impressive feature which probably no other company audio equipment in this range might have.9. Voice Assist Functions: These headphones can be connected to google assistant, SIRI and alexa and perform really well.10. Easy access keys: The headphones are enable with two easy access keys on the left earphone. The custom key toggles between the 3 modes that i've already mentioned above which are guided by the in-built assistant voice. The power key pressed long enough, turns ON/OFF the device and pressed once, the in-built assist provides you with the current % of the battery left.11. Comfort: I should had talked about it earlier, but never mind. With no questions asked these headphones are highly comfortable, the cushion provided is the softest pad your ears can get. Since i am regular spectacle user, i find it hard with headphones imposing excessive pressure over the ears, making it a painful experience, but these headphones give a feather touch to your ears, even if you are specy or even while wearing a face mask. These go good with everything.12. Battery Saver: These headphones tend to power-off on their own if not in use for more than a minute which is a highly power efficient feature added by Sony to the device.Cons:1. If you are into running or any sort of longer workouts, be prepared for sweaty ears. Since the cushions on these headphones completely cover you ears, creating a vacuum sort of environment, no air flows in and out, and the sweat starts dripping down from the earphones, which i must state doesn't affect them at all, only can be slightly irritating sometimes.2. ANC can be difficult to be kept enabled every time since it reduces the environment sounds to almost negligible, which can be dangerous while running or walking at a buss street. Be very careful while using this feature. Probably it is made for environments such as while travelling in a bus or a flight, and seems suitable for these environments.3. Since these headphones can be simultaneously be connected to two devices at once, which is a boon, but is also a slight problem in disguise. Imagine your headphones are connected with your laptop as well as you phone. You are attending an important zoom call while on your laptop and the headphones are in action, your phone starts to ring, now abruptly you'll start hearing you phones ringtone, and the device gets a little startled to which device shall be entertained. i've personally faced this, but i tend not to connect them to two devices at once.PS: One highly important thing is, you won't get an experience of the sound through reading review or watching Youtube videos. You might get a fair image of weather to invest in them or not, but you'll only get the sound experience when you'll listen the music through these bad boys.Read more; I have been using these industry leading headphones by Sony, colour Midnight Blue, and trust me i find them worth every penny spent.

Multi-point feature adds convenience.; With cable they don't use any battery and of course the Sony headphone app with it's equalizer doesn't work then either. I've tried them with and without a DAC (iFi) and they really have a lot of well sounding to deliver to it's user - especially with Hi-Res Lossless and Atmos track. They are easily driven when connected to a computer and the sound was amazing. Breathtaking. I couldn't believe what I was experiencing. Finding nuances in songs I never have heard before. Yes, bluetooth is great but with the cable they really come alive. At least IMHO. As with my XM4 in ear, the bluetooth connection works great and with Sony headphones app (tried on iPhone and iPad) where you can fine tune the equalizer to your liking. Some said that they are bass heavy, but IMHO I wouldn't say that. It's there but not overtaking as some reviewers have stated. Rather quite neutral. Left to test is the noise cancelling when outside so I can't say anything about that yet - but I imagine it's like my in ear XM4 and those take away engine sound, people talking and so on. If you decide to get these I don't think you will be anything but pleased. And for US100 less than the XM5 it's just great. And these head phone cups folds which the XM5 don't... And I have a Boose that are like that and it isn't great - aren't things supposed to get better and more innovative? What I mean is: Great to not feel like being strangled when you take them off and let them rest on your neck. Now I have over ear headphones that hopefully will last as long as my old ones: 20+ years... And with the flexibiity to use bluetooth as well. These are my only over ear from now on. I hope this ""review"" is of some usefulness for you. Cheers!Read more; With cable they don't use any battery and of course the Sony headphone app with it's equalizer doesn't work then either.

Sin duda fueron una compra demasiado buena, pasé de unos Skullcandy Hesh 2 a los Extra Bass y vaya que la diferencia es muy considerable.Ahora, 3 años después decidí hacer un ""upgrade"", yo me dedico a la música, soy estudiante de la materia y me dedico al audio, la verdad es que no puedo llevarme mis audífonos de estudio fuera de casa, necesitaba unos que realmente ofrecieran buena calidad, portabilidad y facilidad de uso con mis aplicaciones. Encontré estos después de hacer un par de búsquedas en internet, los comparé con varias opciones y al final me decidí por comprarlos.En primera debo decir que he quedado impresionado por la tecnología que traen estos audífonos. Puedes personalizar el audio acorde a tu oreja, así es, a la forma de tu oreja, Sony te pide que tomes un par de fotos para que se puedan analizar y proveer mejor experiencia, nunca en mi vida había visto algo así.Desde que los abres se denota un producto bastante premium y que vale el dinero que se paga por él, ya que de hecho no es nada barato.La experiencia de abrirlo es excelente, pero es cuando bajas la aplicación que empiezas a ver lo brutal de estas máquinas. De adelanto estos audífonos ya vienen con carga máxima, o al menos así fue en mi caso, no te pide que los cargues ni nada, funcionan desde que los sacas de la caja. Son extremadamente cómodos y si eres miope como yo y usas fierros para ver, estos audífonos no te van a incomodar en ningún momento.No es que quiera advertir, sino más bien dar aviso de que por defecto los audífonos se oyen un poco flojos, el sonido está un poco saturado, y si te gusta escuchar música como el Heavy Metal o música clásica te quedas pasmado, no se oyen para nada como los Extra Bass que al salir de la caja otorgan un sonido fino y bien configurado. Estos no, pero entiendo por qué lo hacen, ya que como mencioné, la experiencia de verdad comienza cuando bajas la aplicación que tiene como mil opciones de configuración y optimización de sonido, así que prepárate para estar ahí unos 25 minutos de tu vida, que sin duda alguna por supuesto, lo valen.Una vez que has pasado las optimizaciones, toca jugar con el ecualizador, yo recomiendo configuración 400: 1 1K: 3 2.5K: 7 6.3K: 8 16K: 5 Clear Bass: +5 o +7 para escuchar Heavy Metal y música clásica, aunque si eres fan de los medios tal vez quieras mover un poco más, pero como dije, esto es libre y Sony te prevé todas las herramientas para que esto quede sabroso.Ya con todo listo, toca escuchar música, y ahí es cuando te da el golpe. Sabía que habría una diferencia entre los Extra Bass que tengo y los M4 que son estos, pero no sabía que realmente se fuera a notar tanto. Estos no son audífonos, son interfaces de audio andantes, además, Sony te regala una prueba gratis en cualquier servicio de restringe que contenga su servicio Sony Audio 3D, yo escogí Tidal, pero también puedes escoger otros 3 más, ahí aparece la opción.De verdad que escuchar música en formato de alta calidad como es el FLAC que te ofrece Tidal es algo maravilloso, inclusive después de varios años escuchando lo mismo, logré notar varios elementos musicales extras que antes ni sabía que existían en la canción, ahí es cuando te vas para atrás, es como por fin escuchar las cosas sin filtro. También recomiendo el formato ""Loss-less"" de Apple music en caso de que sean usuarios de iPhone o solo para que tengan una tercera opción. Sea cual sea el servicio que escojan, se oye increíble, pero sin duda combinado con formatos de baja compresión esto se vuelve místico.Claro que esto no es tan plano como unos audífonos de estudio, pero sin duda la experiencia se acerca bastante.En conclusión, estos audífonos realmente son un producto bastante premium, te otorgan no solo alta calidad de audio, sino una experiencia tecnológica muy innovadora, además vienen con su porta audiófonos y cables correspondientes, son muy cómodos y portables. Los recomiendo al 100% no duden en adquirirlo para nada.Read more; Review completo como consumidor y profesional dedicado al audio, si te da flojera leer, de entrada te digo que esto vale cada centavo, no lo dudes ni esperes, rompe el cochinito porque te lo estás perdiendo.Ahora si para los que dudan de Dios:Hace 3 años adquirí los MDR-XB950N1, mejor conocidos como los Sony Extra Bass.

"Sony WH-CH520 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery-Beige","₹4,449",4.1,B0BZPK3XFQ,https://www.amazon.in/Sony-WH-CH520-Headphones-Multipoint-Connectivity/dp/B0BZPK3XFQ/ref=sr_1_19?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.txEjLiMOdAOFe15CvlkHgZP6MKt62XQZzhFfVKvT44_u_cTgMAjayEe_qJiM1ols70BUulsFYDO96ZGYEOtOh7wV1vlea_PFemA9CFQE-Dx_83QSXb7tPz15JP1MhUxntPPKLcByWaIItCuqZpveaymxz4C_RIZB25VmoQ_CprEBrRCFiV8yEqAKVqqo-BbyJpxO_xvBgnyTPSCwOd5LrNqhN-acKfLLtLJU5UMxWzc.tJ5wHCVcxNkwbn5Yg4K7g1huRAWD8mFobZSSDE7rMiA&dib_tag=se&keywords=headphones&qid=1747130623&sr=8-19,"So if you're considering to buy this pair of headphones or have already brought it and need a little tweak to the sound to up the excitement, give this review a read. I know it's somewhat lengthy :( but if you've already bought this pair, skip to the last part, that is, bonus.Sound quality:-Pretty good. As you might know, Sony is Sony when it comes to sound. The audio is clear and has that calm, balanced profile that I prefer to the bass oriented profiles of BoAt and JBL. If you are a basshead, I don't think these headphones will be your go to. But if you've been using bass heavy headphones, you will feel and instant change in audio quality and the overall beauty of music once you switch to a Sony device. Keep in mind that I'm not a professional audiophile or something. I love listening to quality music and watching movies and these headphones are perfect. I use Apple music and the sound is bliss, idk about Spotify though but I think it will fare equally well. I like bass and these headphones do provide bass, just that they are not overkill and distort the entire sound looking for it. These feel more premium in the sound department. However some people might feel a lack of excitement in their sound out of the box. Worry not, I've added an EQ tweak to fix your problem at the end of this review.Specs:-30mm drivers. So not as loud as the 40mm ones BoAt and JBL offer in this price range. But I've felt (personally) the audio quality to be better. Bluetooth 5.2 which is solid. Multipoint connection makes sure that this will not be outdated soon. They've been released in 2023 and will remain in contention for atleast a couple of years. Multipoint has to be turned on in headphones app and I use it to connect the headphones to my Macbook to watch movies and to my android phone, which might be on charging or in another room, to attend calls. The switching is seamless and works well. They don't have touch controls though, so it will take a couple of tries to learn to get the buttons right, especially in a dark room. They have DSEE which is basically a feature to enhance low quality/ compressed audios downloaded from internet. It has to be turned on in the app and is not needed for Spotify or Apple music as they are already best quality music and DSEE takes up additional battery charge. Battery is solid. They were 70% out of the box and after 20 hr playback still had 50% left. So I guess they'll last for atleast 50 hrs like they claim on the box. I don't like charging my devices all the time and I use them for max 5 hrs a day for which they will last close to 2 weeks which is good. No ANC though, it's not a problem for me but if it is for you, don't buy. Mic is good, I've attended calls in the midst of traffic and they were pretty fine.Comfort:-I've tried many midrange headphones and these are some of the best in terms of comfort too. Soft earcups that sit compact on my ear. However if they are not positioned properly, they might exert pressure. But on proper positioning, they will give 2 to 2.5 hours playback without any discomfort. After that you will have to take a break. I don't have big ears btw. They are lightweight and have an adjustable headband with cushion. So as far as on ear headphones are concerned, these are comfortable.Build:-Plastic but feels durable. Not creaking. The earcups are the types which forms wrinkles, they look durable but I don't know if they will pinch unless I use it for atleast 6 months. Anyway these have replacement earcups available online and in Sony service centers. I have one near my house. I don't think they are sweat resistant so don't use it for workouts. For jogging they will stay in place once positioned compactly, but for running they will slip off ear.Drawbacks:-Lack of aux cable. Once you are out of charge, that's that. It says they support fast charging on box, but I haven't tried that so idk. Normally takes 2 hours atleast to charge from 20 to 100. Another drawback is portability. They are not foldable and even though the plastic feels durable, I'd suggest you don't bump them much. While travelling either buy a case or carry them around in the box they come with (don't worry about looking cheap, the box doesn't have anything like specs or other bs written on it. Only thing written is Sony. It's inside the white cover that mentions specs).Conclusion:-They offer value for money if you ask me. The sound is premium for a budget segment and not too bass oriented. The headphone app means it will get firmware updates and has some listening modes that actually work, it is not a gimmick. They look and feel premium too. And unlike Anker or ATH, they have service centers all over so if any issue pops up, that's an added boost too. The don't have an in box warranty card but worry not, the moment you connect your device to the headphones app they are registered. Keep the Amazon invoice with you, in the box or download it in pdf form from your orders section.Bonus:-If the headphones lack excitement to you out of the box, the headphones app offer some preset EQ. But I will share this tweak I found from reddit. They worked for me so if you don't know how to configure the EQ on your own, try this;Select manual on EQ in Sony headphones app.Put 400 to 2.Put 1k to 4.Put 2.5k to 7.Put 6.3k to 7.Put 16k to 5.Put clear bass to 2.Try out this tweak and see if it works for you. This works on some higher end Sony models too. Enjoy your headphones!!!Read more; So if you're considering to buy this pair of headphones or have already brought it and need a little tweak to the sound to up the excitement, give this review a read. I know it's somewhat lengthy :( but if you've already bought this pair, skip to the last part, that is, bonus.Sound quality:-Pretty good. As you might know, Sony is Sony when it comes to sound. The audio is clear and has that calm, balanced profile that I prefer to the bass oriented profiles of BoAt and JBL. If you are a basshead, I don't think these headphones will be your go to. But if you've been using bass heavy headphones, you will feel and instant change in audio quality and the overall beauty of music once you switch to a Sony device. Keep in mind that I'm not a professional audiophile or something. I love listening to quality music and watching movies and these headphones are perfect. I use Apple music and the sound is bliss, idk about Spotify though but I think it will fare equally well. I like bass and these headphones do provide bass, just that they are not overkill and distort the entire sound looking for it. These feel more premium in the sound department. However some people might feel a lack of excitement in their sound out of the box. Worry not, I've added an EQ tweak to fix your problem at the end of this review.Specs:-30mm drivers. So not as loud as the 40mm ones BoAt and JBL offer in this price range. But I've felt (personally) the audio quality to be better. Bluetooth 5.2 which is solid. Multipoint connection makes sure that this will not be outdated soon. They've been released in 2023 and will remain in contention for atleast a couple of years. Multipoint has to be turned on in headphones app and I use it to connect the headphones to my Macbook to watch movies and to my android phone, which might be on charging or in another room, to attend calls. The switching is seamless and works well. They don't have touch controls though, so it will take a couple of tries to learn to get the buttons right, especially in a dark room. They have DSEE which is basically a feature to enhance low quality/ compressed audios downloaded from internet. It has to be turned on in the app and is not needed for Spotify or Apple music as they are already best quality music and DSEE takes up additional battery charge. Battery is solid. They were 70% out of the box and after 20 hr playback still had 50% left. So I guess they'll last for atleast 50 hrs like they claim on the box. I don't like charging my devices all the time and I use them for max 5 hrs a day for which they will last close to 2 weeks which is good. No ANC though, it's not a problem for me but if it is for you, don't buy. Mic is good, I've attended calls in the midst of traffic and they were pretty fine.Comfort:-I've tried many midrange headphones and these are some of the best in terms of comfort too. Soft earcups that sit compact on my ear. However if they are not positioned properly, they might exert pressure. But on proper positioning, they will give 2 to 2.5 hours playback without any discomfort. After that you will have to take a break. I don't have big ears btw.

These are fine only with the person having smaller or average size.3) It doesnt suit for gaming.4) Sound mixture of high and low can be designed well as i feel its flat in few places where it could have been better.Read more; Pros:1) The sound quality is good.2) If you are looking for decent headset which has all amenities.3) Connectivity and functionality is fine and its compatible with IOS as well which is great!!!!4) Battery as of now hasnt had any problem.Cons:1) The noise cancellation could have been better.2) The headset does not suit for everyone in terms of head size.

Thank to Sony service.Read more; Nice headphone, comfort to both ears, sound clarity awesome, actually in sound systems Sony is top no other brand can't reach Sony brand sound quality, finally I loved it. Thank to Sony service.; Muy cómodos, en mi trabajo participo en muchas reuniones virtuales y hay días en que los traigo puestos tal vez 5 o 6 horas seguidas sin quitármelos y no me molestan, a veces hasta se me olvida que los traigo. Excelente conectividad bluetooth con el celular y laptop, se pueden conectar ambos a la vez. En el gimnasio los he usado corriendo y haciendo todo tipo de ejercicios y son cómodos, ligeros y no se mueven. Los he sudado y la cubierta de las almohadillas no se ha dañado nada. El audio es buenísimo, muy bien nivelado y aunque no tienen cancelación de ruido, con un volumen moderado y por las mismas almohadillas, aisla lo suficientemente bien como para que los ruidos o música del gimnasio, por ejemplo, queden muy en el fondo. Nunca ha sido necesario subir al máximo el volumen. Además con la app puedes ecualizar a tu gusto, también recomiendo, si usas Spotify, ecualizar ahí para tener la mejor experiencia posible. La batería dura muchísimo, en 3 meses de uso usándolos en promedio 3 o 4 horas diarias y solo los he puesto a cargar 3 veces. Cargan muy rápido también. El único detalle que les he encontrado es que con mi SmartTV Hisense, jugando Playstation tiene un delay de medio segundo o 1 segundo, y con Youtube cada 40 segundos o 1 minuto ""se brinca"" o ""se come"" como 1 segundo tanto del audio como del video. Pero para mi no ha sido problema porque realmente solo los uso para escuchar música desde mi celular y para tener llamadas de trabajo. En resumen, son cómodos, lucen bien, sobrios y de buena calidad, muy buen audio y excelente rendimiento de batería.Read more; Muy cómodos, en mi trabajo participo en muchas reuniones virtuales y hay días en que los traigo puestos tal vez 5 o 6 horas seguidas sin quitármelos y no me molestan, a veces hasta se me olvida que los traigo.

I cannot say enough.Read more; I've had thse headphones, for two months now, for the gym and I still have not charged them since the day I got them. I cannot say enough.; The product arrived well packaged.  There was a delivery delay but it was not horrendous and to be expected given that it was ordered during Parime Days,The headphones arrived almost fully charged,  Set up was relatively easy, but you really do need to use their app to complete the set up process.  The app also allows you to change some settings and select equalizer settings that work for you.The switches have a nice feel to them.  They do have raised areas designed to help you find the correct switch by feel.  There are times however when I find that it is easier to adjust the volume using the phone or I remove the headphone to make a change.  This is a very subjective items so you may not have the same issue.  No stars were deducted for that reason.These are an on ear device.  It was not uncomfortable to me, but it did take some getting used to and here again...Personal preference comes into play.  On a warm and humid day you may experience some sweating where the ear cup rides on your ear.  That may allow for some movement / shifting of the headphone depending on what you are doing.  They may thus not work out well for use doing exercising as an example.The sound quality is great at this price point.  I have Bose ear buds.  The sound from this device is not Bose quality and you should not expect it to be Bose quality.  It is good to very good however.  The equalizer settings allow you to control all five typical equalizer settings PLUS a separate adjustment for th4 bass.Paring was easy and fast.  The connection remains stable most of the time.  There is a selection that allows you to select either top quality sound or a more stable connection.  I chose sound quality an the vast majority of the time the connection was stable with no noise present.  There may be times however, that due to local conditions / interference you may have a little popping or very brief drop out.  I have worn these headphones a LOT since they arrived and while I have experienced that, it was very limited.  Now I also have a lot of electric / electronic devices in use on my property and that will may explain what I experienced.  I did have some interference from some household devices when I wass very close to them.The battery life seems to be very good.  I have worn m for several hours and the voice system still indicates 100% at startup. Unlike my Bose products the battery monitoring system is not linear where it will call out 100%, 90%, 80%b etc...  It may call out 100% until the battery hits 50% (As an example) and then te voice system will drop from stating 100% to 50%.  I do not see that as an issue or negative given the very long stated by the manufacturer battery life, and I have no disagreement with their claims about battery life aty this point in time,So again...Thus far I am very pleased with the fit, quality, and sound quality of these headphones.  Do bed aware that tey are NOT noise cancelling.  There will be some outside noise reduction dur to the ear cups of course.Read more; The product arrived well packaged.

Amazon will only take responsibility if the product is damaged upon delivery. If the product turns out to be defective or has other issues, Amazon won't help—you'll have to claim the warranty through boAt's service center.And before you rely on that, I suggest you check out how boAt's service actually is—just search on YouTube. Also, watch the video I’ve shared.I bought these headphones myself and received a defective product. When I plugged in the AUX cable and played games, my teammates kept hearing an irritating noise. I tested it on both iPad and Android, plus six other devices—the issue was the same every time.When I contacted Amazon, they said the product wasn’t damaged, so I should reach out to boAt. BoAt picked up my product, kept it for 13 days, and then sent the same unit back saying there was no issue with it. So, I didn’t even get a replacement.Read more; Guys, before buying these headphones, make sure to carefully read the return/replacement terms and conditions.

I have never thought that the boat headphones would have this bad quality. Even if they import from China they should at least give good quality for the price they are charging for the product.

The sound quality is excellent, with rich bass and clear highs, which is perfect for music, movies, and even gaming. The BEAST mode with 40ms low latency is a great touch, making gaming feel smooth and immersive without any lag.Battery life is another highlight – it lasts up to 40 hours, so I’ve been able to use them for days without charging. The adaptive fit is comfortable too, even for long listening sessions, and the headphones feel lightweight yet sturdy.Another great feature is the environmental noise cancelling , which makes calls crystal clear by reducing background noise. I’ve also found the voice assistant activation really convenient for multitasking. Overall, these headphones deliver amazing value for money. If you’re looking for a budget-friendly, high-quality pair of Bluetooth headphones, I’d highly recommend the boAt Rockerz 430!Read more; I’ve been using the boAt Rockerz 430 for about a week now, and I’m honestly pretty impressed.

I use this for 2 to 2.5 day may be 6-7 hours a day.. it's comes with a 3.5mm jack- so you can use it even if you runs out of battery. Cushions could have been softer and sweat absorbing- if using in an air conditioned room, this isn't a prob.Felt this was little heavier compared to the one I used earlier - Sennihiser and Sony headphones I used were a little expensive.Problem comes if you travel with this-bulk it is.I prefer a foldable over-the head. Headbands are adjustable but if you change them frequently plastic will have a wear and tear.

The sponge covering torn of completely after 1 year of usage and one side of the headphone broke while taking them  off my head, Really like the audio quality. One more thing I like to include is the charging port, it's built very loosely, you have to bend the whole cable and keep it tight near the port to charge.Pros: Audio quality is just awesome, u can use these headphones while listening to music ans gaming(with aux cable) too.It's is really comfortable near the ears and ear doesn't hurts after 5-6hrs of continuous usage.Battery life is also good I used to charge once in 4-6days and mostly used bluetooth.I did paired(Bluetooth only) it with my laptop and mobile at same time but headphones only process one device sound at a time so I had to mute other time to time to shift onto devices. So u have to manage this thing.It pairs with device easily without any issue or without taking much time. The aux cable is good too not too tight or too loose just perfect.Head adjustment mechanism is kinda funny because the headphones moves side to side faster when u take headphones out of adjustment idk why, could be less friction.While gaming with aux cable on u can get 0 latency(no sound delay) and can differentiate between lefts and rights and it's really helpful.I don't know the weight of headphones but they feels light on head so u can play games or watch movies without headacheCons: Build quality, full plastic body with only metal strip on head adjustment band and the plastic quality is ok ok...(cuz it broke ;-;)Charging port is loosely fitted so you have to sacrifice your cable life spanCushion are comfy but the skin or we say covering starts to fall off after some time and the headphones looks like dog water.High latency in Bluetooth mode making it use aux cable while gaming only and if u dont have aux cable port in your device so just quit these headphones and look for something else.Looks too big on head so won't recommend for gym, walk usage.You came across whole review so here's ur cookie 🍪!Read more; Personal Feedback: I didn't like the build quality at all.

You will definitely get price drop. If you get them at around 800rs, then also it is good.At this price you get braided 2M cable also with rgb and with mic and good sound quality. What else you need!!!; Writing this review after 2 weeks of use. The headphones are big and a bit heavy but you get used it in a while. It's lowkey good for gaming, has no sound delays or anything and while listening music the sound is good considering its price. It got a 3.5mm jack for both output and mic so it'll only work on phones or other devices which have only one port for both. Because I bought this for my pc I had to buy a headphone splitter seperately to get both output and mic work both at once other than that it works perfectly fine. The mic is a little bit too lose though which could be improved. If you want a good quality headphone for a price of around 700 (which I bought for), you should go for it.Read more; Writing this review after 2 weeks of use.

Lightweight and comfortable, with good noise cancellation and clear sound quality. Battery life is excellent, lasting up to 35 hours with ANC on. Multipoint pairing is a plus for switching devices easily.Here’s a review for the Sony WH-CH720N headphonesSony has a strong reputation for delivering high-quality audio products, and the WH-CH720N is a mid-range noise-canceling headphone that aims to balance affordability, comfort, and performance.Design & ComfortOne of the standout features of the CH720N is its lightweight build. At just 192 grams, it’s among the lightest ANC headphones in its category, making it comfortable for long listening sessions. The earcups are well-padded, though the plastic build might not feel as premium as Sony’s higher-end models like the WH-1000XM5.Sound QualitySony has equipped these headphones with 30mm drivers, and while they don’t deliver the deep bass of the XM series, they provide clear mids and crisp highs, making them ideal for vocals and balanced soundtracks. The DSEE (Digital Sound Enhancement Engine) helps restore some lost details in compressed music, improving overall audio clarity.Noise Cancellation & Ambient ModeThe Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is powered by Sony’s V1 processor, the same one used in the WH-1000XM5, though the effectiveness is slightly toned down. It effectively reduces low-frequency noises like airplane hums and air conditioners but struggles with high-pitched sounds. The Ambient Sound Mode is a great addition, allowing users to stay aware of their surroundings when needed.Battery Life & ConnectivitySony claims a 35-hour battery life with ANC on, which is impressive. Even with heavy use, you can go several days without charging. A quick 3-minute charge provides 1 hour of playback, which is great for those on the go. Connectivity is seamless with Bluetooth 5.2 and multipoint pairing, allowing you to switch between devices effortlessly.Call Quality & Extra FeaturesThe beamforming microphones and AI noise reduction improve call clarity, making it a decent choice for work calls. Sony’s Headphones Connect app offers sound customization, including an EQ adjustment and 360 Reality Audio support.Pros & Cons✔️ Lightweight and comfortable for long usage✔️ Good ANC for the price✔️ Balanced sound quality with DSEE upscaling✔️ Excellent battery life✔️ Multipoint Bluetooth pairing❌ Plastic build feels less premium❌ ANC isn't as strong as higher-end modelsThe Sony WH-CH720N is an excellent mid-range ANC headphone for those who want Sony’s signature sound and noise cancellation without breaking the bank. While it lacks the premium feel and top-tier ANC of the XM series, its lightweight design, solid audio quality, and long battery life make it a great option for daily usInitially, I received a damaged outer box, but the seller promptly replaced it, ensuring a smooth experience. Appreciate their quick response!Overall, a solid choice for daily use at this price point.Read more; Great mid-range ANC headphones!

Appreciate their quick response!Overall, a solid choice for daily use at this price point.; I am using it continuously for last 6 months and gave it 5🌟 overall for the things it offers in the price of just 6k... Yes 6k is just the initiation of good quality ANC bluetooth over the ear headset, people are expecting XM or bose or Sennheiser quality in 6k or 8k,lol....if it's in 8k or 10k range i would give it 4🌟 instead. Here's my findings —Pros:-1. Sound output - 4.5/5 ... Default sound is pretty flat, but quickly gets interesting after playing with eq, dsee, anc etc. . Sound volume is pretty average but distortion in max vol. is low. It's a general purpose headset, good enough for all aspects like rock, pop, bass,instrumental, classical, rap etc. . Seperation is nice, different tones have distinct identities. But for specific needs like for bass or vocal, strech your budget a bit more. I don't think you can get better than this balance of sound output in this budget.2. ANC - 4/5 actually it's pretty decent, but could be a little better. Afterall it's an entry level ANC.3. Built - 4.5/5 simplistic plastic built, no fancy cosmetics, but solid and mature, very much flexible, not gonna break anytime, good elasticity for sticking with head. Though it's plastic built but has stainless steel housing around stretchable arms which is very nice to have for long term usage. Most headsets break from this sections.4. Battery- 5/5 fabulous battery life even with anc on . Charging it like smartphones from 20 to 90% and getting about 1 week to 10 days of battery life with intense usage. Charging takes about 50 mins for the above session.5. Comfort - 4/5 nice padded ear cups, but brings sweat quickly and then feels a bit warm... But prolonged usage doesn't hurt that much as once i had used it about 2hrs at a single strech.6. Connectivity- 5/5 very strong bluetooth connectivity, works seamlessly even with 10 meters of distance with walls and different floors.But still not that useful for online gaming via wireless mode as it has a little bit of latency.Cons. :-1. Crap when connected to PC via wire and headset turned off.2. Like other over the ear, gets uncomfortable in scorching summer and humid conditions.3. Lack of ldac , hence no hi-res audio, but in this price bracket it's ok.4. Though doesn't feel cheap, but some aesthetics should be there.Verdict:- You can absolutely go with it if you are getting it around 6000/- for no specific taste. Don't expect it to outperform those ult or XMs, it's illogical to think. If you want the ultimate one then there are XM, momentum, quitecomfort or those beyerdynamics....instead of going with intermediates, either go with this one or go with those super expensive ones. And those people comparing it with much lower priced headphones and saying it worse, they simply don't have the sensitivity to differentiate between subtle frequencies, and those subtle frequencies make it sweet.'Made for iPhone/iPod' written on the outside of the box, which is strange, probably will work better with ios than android. I'm an android user (pixel) though:).At last, it's a sweet headphone.Those images are after 6 months of usage!!Read more; I am using it continuously for last 6 months and gave it 5🌟 overall for the things it offers in the price of just 6k...

The sound quality is truly remarkable, delivering a rich and immersive audio experience that brings my music and podcasts to life. Whether I'm jamming to my favorite tunes or engrossed in a podcast, the clarity and depth of the sound are truly impressive.One of the standout features for me is the microphone's noise cancellation capabilities. While it may not completely eliminate all background noise, it does a commendable job of reducing ambient sounds during calls. The result is clear and crisp communication without the distractions of external noise. It's perfect for virtual meetings and online gaming sessions where effective communication is key.The design of the headphone is sleek and comfortable, making it suitable for extended wear. The over-ear cups provide a snug fit without causing discomfort, and the adjustable headband ensures a customized and secure fit. The build quality also feels robust, indicating durability for everyday use.I appreciate the user-friendly controls that allow me to adjust volume, skip tracks, and manage calls effortlessly. The Bluetooth connectivity is reliable, providing a stable connection with my devices without any noticeable lag.Overall, this headphone is a solid choice for anyone seeking a combination of excellent sound quality and decent noise cancellation. It strikes a great balance between performance and affordability, making it a valuable addition to my audio gear.

Ele é leve, emparelha com todos os meus dispositivos e carrega rapidamente.  A redução de ruídos é muito boa também. Contudo, fiquei um pouco frustrada mesmo por ele não vir com o estojo para viagem, que é vendido de forma avulsa e custa quase R$200,00. Se eu tivesse me atentado a esse detalhe, teria pagado um pouco mais em um modelo mais avançado. Outro ponto que para mim é negativo é que ele pesa um pouquino e sinto os maxilares travarem no início, mas depois de algum tempo me adapto e não sinto mais incômodo.Enfim, é uma boa opção de fone, mas se estiver disposto a pagar um pouco a mais é melhor comprar um modelo mais recente.Read more; Estou satisfeita com o fone.

Overall it is a good buy for my outdoor runs.; UPDATE 31MARCH2025: (This post will help people as I see many reporting issues with connectivity/distortion/quality. )The issue as I see is with Samsung Android devices and not with other phones like nothing 2a as a family member has that and this headphone works fine there. Nevertheless, if you experience distortion or quality issues, you can try changing the bluetooth codec as mentioned below.Samsung has its own codec too which it uses for its earbuds.UPDATE 30MARCH2025: (This post will help people as I see many reporting issues with connectivity/distortion/quality. )Mostly as I saw the reviews - issues reported were with distorted sound/quality of sound and with a set of devices and mostly people saying that it was seen with windows pc. I was able to fix the problem myself. PLEASE NOTE: There was no help from Noise. Noise tech did not help troubleshoot.).My ticket was just closed from Noise end and so I realised if I went back there again,  the device would just  go back and forth only but my problem would not get fixed. No one from Noise called me through the entire process to even understand the issue in detail or even when it was marked checked after sending it back for the first time.----TECHNICAL EXPLANATION---How I solved the issue - A common problem reported from multiple reviews was about distortion(sometimes written as quality) and was with some devices and then mostly with windows pc users. So, it cannot be that such a priced headphone will have substandard quality when some verified purchases reviews having 5 stars. The battery is good. So, some issue might be with the chipset hardware.""Codec"" is coding-decoding and a bluetooth codec is used to compress and decompress audio data for efficient wireless transmission. Depending upon the codec the quality of your sound differs.This device seems to be defaulting to AAC (advcd audio encoding) which apple devices use. I had to go to ""Developer Options"" in android (to enable ""Developer Options"" in Android please google it) and try another codec. I switched to SBC (Sub-Band Codec) on my phone which is a very old codec and is prone to losses, and then it sounded fine. Attached two images for reference.for Samsung:1 Go to ""Settings""2 Tap ""About device"" or ""About phone""3 Tap “Software information”4 Tap “Build number” seven times. ...5 Enter your pattern, PIN or password to enable the Developer options menu.6 The ""Developer options"" menu will now appear in your Settings menu.PLEASE NOTE: YOUR PHONE NEEDS TO BE CONNECTED/PAIRED WITH THE HEADSET FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE BLUETOOTH CODEC OPTION IN YOUR ""DEVELOPER OPTIONS"" IN ANDROID. IF YOU ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE HEADSET, THE OPTION FOR CODEC SELECTION WILL BE GRAYED OUT.But upon shutting down and turning back on after few hours, when it pairs again, the setting goes back to AAC at times. Its a pain changing it again when you disconnect and reconnect back.On PC its completely distorted. Windows does not allow to change codecs. Based on what I found, it does not have selections like we have for Android. I will keep looking for a way to change it.Whichever manufacturer the chipset is being imported from, is having different codecs than samsung android.UPDATE 29MARCH2025:I received the headphones back from noise and they just sent back the same thing in broken state.I cannot imagine why a company is doing this. It's like ""here its back again but just in a diff box""Now again open a ticket and then send back item. Why did i purchase this from amazon in the first place. I should have gone to a shop purchased it. Atleast would not be facing this.Complete utter disregard to customer. Its customer problem. Let him be with a broken thing.========================Never seen such worse quality by paying this much money. Sound distorted right out from the box. Listen to audio -spotify or anything, even phone call, sound is heavily distorted. Any other of my old bluetooth headphones and earphones are fine. Breaks heavily in between. I do not know how even people gave it 5 stars. But if you hear a music, its as if like the audio tape is getting stuck in between.Not worth the money. Defective in sound right from the box. Never seen such bad quality that too for a higher priced item.And to top it, Amazon's stand is this has to be taken up with noise only. That too I just received it today.I opened up a ticket with noise. Will have to wait for their response.Have never seen such a worse pricey product.Read more; UPDATE 31MARCH2025: (This post will help people as I see many reporting issues with connectivity/distortion/quality. )The issue as I see is with Samsung Android devices and not with other phones like nothing 2a as a family member has that and this headphone works fine there.

IF YOU ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE HEADSET, THE OPTION FOR CODEC SELECTION WILL BE GRAYED OUT.But upon shutting down and turning back on after few hours, when it pairs again, the setting goes back to AAC at times. Its a pain changing it again when you disconnect and reconnect back.On PC its completely distorted. Windows does not allow to change codecs. Based on what I found, it does not have selections like we have for Android. I will keep looking for a way to change it.Whichever manufacturer the chipset is being imported from, is having different codecs than samsung android.UPDATE 29MARCH2025:I received the headphones back from noise and they just sent back the same thing in broken state.I cannot imagine why a company is doing this. It's like ""here its back again but just in a diff box""Now again open a ticket and then send back item. Why did i purchase this from amazon in the first place. I should have gone to a shop purchased it. Atleast would not be facing this.Complete utter disregard to customer. Its customer problem. Let him be with a broken thing.========================Never seen such worse quality by paying this much money. Sound distorted right out from the box. Listen to audio -spotify or anything, even phone call, sound is heavily distorted. Any other of my old bluetooth headphones and earphones are fine. Breaks heavily in between. I do not know how even people gave it 5 stars. But if you hear a music, its as if like the audio tape is getting stuck in between.Not worth the money. Defective in sound right from the box. Never seen such bad quality that too for a higher priced item.And to top it, Amazon's stand is this has to be taken up with noise only. That too I just received it today.I opened up a ticket with noise. Will have to wait for their response.Have never seen such a worse pricey product.; The Noise Airwave Max 4 headphones offer great sound quality and long battery life.They’re comfortable for extended use with soft ear cushions and a lightweight build.Dual pairing and low latency make them ideal for multitasking and gaming.At this price point, they’re a solid value choice for everyday listening.Read more; The Noise Airwave Max 4 headphones offer great sound quality and long battery life.They’re comfortable for extended use with soft ear cushions and a lightweight build.Dual pairing and low latency make them ideal for multitasking and gaming.At this price point, they’re a solid value choice for everyday listening.; The Noise Airwave Max 4 offers incredible 70-hour battery life and comfortable earcups for hours of listening.

Secondly the battery life is amazing, on a single charge I use this for like 40-45 Hrs and it still doesn't stop! Sound quality is decent in these but it's not cheap at all, tho i would say the durability is below average in these, but it's totally fine for an average user. Most importantly the mic is trash, i bought one of these in 2021 which broke in 2024 so I bought it again in 2024 and in both of the models, the mics did not work and that's the only drawback of this Headphone.Read more; The best headphones in this budget, I'm 6'3 and I have a big skull and ears but these fit perfectly on my head and are very comfortable!

Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is almost fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). It is average in terms of gaming. If you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. You can buy this headphone for games like Minecraft. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.Thank you for reading. Just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.Read more; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition.

Although I am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. There is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. Which is a pity, but ah well. Can't have it all, can ya?Best bluetooth headphones at 799 for sound AND mic quality. And let's not forget comfort. Headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.Although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.Even though I have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  Even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. So if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these. But if you don't mind going for EARPHONES, then there are many better options available in terms of sound quality.Read more; Surprisingly exceeded my expectations.

Gaming is bit of controversial as some might find it good but lemme tell u one thing that the latency is always not good at this price point but these are good for any story mode games and ok ok for competitive games.Hope it helps☺️Btw I got them for 800 rs.Read more; These headphones are good for the price but there is only one major problem that is comfort...I mean that you will not be able to wear them for long sessions otherwise it's overall a banger considering it's price.

The vocals are clear if you increase your volume to 50% + but it does have a con will share in a moment- if you are under 20 age with small to medium head then it is suitable for you :)- yes the SD card works very well just make sure your SD card is clean and only has .mp3 files.-Gamers you can go for it if you don't play sports! Then go for it, Emin gaming mode it has very minimal latency which unfortunately I can't count but yeah I play a lot of games so it is working very well, you can play in 80% volume no leakage :) depends on the game also! The aux cable and gaming mode both works equally same and is really good :)- Voice call quality is 8/10 :)CONS:-if you have bigger head don't buy it, it will fit your head easily but then the cushions will start hurting in 3-4 hours so yeah like I have medium to bigger head so it hurts a bit after some hours-Cushions doesn't absorb any sweat!- it has sound leakage issue so basically above 60% or above 50% the sound comes out!

From the moment I received the product, it has been nothing but a headache. The headphones are completely defective – the Bluetooth feature does not work at all. I tried connecting them to multiple phones, including different brands and models, but the headphones simply refuse to pair. It’s clear that the product is faulty, and no amount of troubleshooting has made a difference.When I reached out to the seller for assistance, their response was utterly unhelpful. They provided no useful solutions or support, and it felt like they were just brushing me off. I then tried to initiate a return and refund through Amazon, only to find out that it’s not possible. How is this even acceptable? I paid for a product that doesn’t function as advertised, and now I’m stuck with it. It’s incredibly frustrating to feel like I’ve been scammed out of my money.To make matters worse, Amazon’s customer service was no help either. They were unable to resolve the issue and offered no real solution. It’s shocking that a platform as large as Amazon would allow such poor-quality products to be sold and then fail to support customers when things go wrong. The entire experience has left me feeling cheated and helpless.This purchase has been a total waste of time and money. The headphones are useless, the seller is unresponsive, and Amazon’s customer service is ineffective. I regret ever buying this product and will definitely think twice before making another purchase on Amazon. The lack of accountability from both the seller and Amazon is unacceptable.I would strongly advise others to avoid this seller and be cautious when shopping on Amazon. There’s no guarantee that you’ll receive a functional product, and if something goes wrong, you might be left with no recourse. Save yourself the frustration and shop elsewhere. This experience has been a complete disaster, and I will never recommend this seller or rely on Amazon for a resolution again.Read more; I am beyond disappointed with my recent purchase of wireless Bluetooth headphones from Amazon.

Got these an attractive price in Feb 2025.1. Sound: The quality of sound / clarity is impressive, balanced and clear across bass, mid and treble. The bass is a passive bass (rich in tone but no physical vibration as I understand it means). The default bass is a bit rich for me so I toned it down using the EQ in the Bose App. Other than that, the rest is crystal clear to my ears.2. Active Noise Cancellation: Not seen better ANC in this price range. QC Ultras take it up a couple of notches with intelligent ANC adjusting to ambience. You can customise as per needs using modes. The “ANC level” control is no more accessible as a button, but instead is now set in “modes”. You can add any number of custom modes and mark some modes as favourites and the favourites can be toggled through using the multifunction button, when in use.If you want to simply tune out of the world with nothing playing on the device/ headphones, that works too. Silence.3. Designed for comfort and fit: Lightweight with a cushioned headband and ear pads hinged to an articulated aluminium frame, QC Ultras are designed well for long listening sessions avoiding ear fatigue.4. Battery Life: Upto a day on music, with a quick charge feature when needed.5. Connectivity: The Bluetooth 5.3 is enabled, and it can toggle between two devices at the press of a button (say, phone and laptop).6. Functionality has changed from previous generations with the volume control enabled through a capacitive-touch rib at the back of the right ear pad.7.Spatial audio is an addition. The spatial audio effect is easily observable. But, some fixing is needed to make the sound as good as when using without spatial audio. Maybe a firmware/software update coming soon?Bose QC Ultra headphones are superior for ANC, comfortable wearing, and sound clarity.Read more; QC Ultras are being quoted as Bose’s best ANC headphones to date.

Previously, I owned the Sony WH-1000XM3, which was excellent.This model is undoubtedly an upgrade in terms of sound quality, fit, and noise cancellation. However, I did encounter one unusual issue—Bluetooth remained connected for hours even after removing the headphone, instead of disconnecting and entering sleep mode as expected. It happened only once, so it’s hard to say whether it was a firmware glitch or just a rare occurrence. Unfortunately, this did result in some battery drain.I purchased the Bose 60th Anniversary variant for around ₹25,000, which was certainly a great deal.Read more; After using the Bose QuietComfort Ultra for a month while traveling by flight and bus, as well as at home, I’m sharing my review.

Got these an attractive price in Feb 2025.1. Sound: The quality of sound / clarity is impressive, balanced and clear across bass, mid and treble. The bass is a passive bass (rich in tone but no physical vibration as I understand it means). The default bass is a bit rich for me so I toned it down using the EQ in the Bose App. Other than that, the rest is crystal clear to my ears.2. Active Noise Cancellation: Not seen better ANC in this price range. QC Ultras take it up a couple of notches with intelligent ANC adjusting to ambience. You can customise as per needs using modes. The “ANC level” control is no more accessible as a button, but instead is now set in “modes”. You can add any number of custom modes and mark some modes as favourites and the favourites can be toggled through using the multifunction button, when in use.If you want to simply tune out of the world with nothing playing on the device/ headphones, that works too. Silence.3. Designed for comfort and fit: Lightweight with a cushioned headband and ear pads hinged to an articulated aluminium frame, QC Ultras are designed well for long listening sessions avoiding ear fatigue.4. Battery Life: Upto a day on music, with a quick charge feature when needed.5. Connectivity: The Bluetooth 5.3 is enabled, and it can toggle between two devices at the press of a button (say, phone and laptop).6. Functionality has changed from previous generations with the volume control enabled through a capacitive-touch rib at the back of the right ear pad.7.Spatial audio is an addition. The spatial audio effect is easily observable. But, some fixing is needed to make the sound as good as when using without spatial audio. Maybe a firmware/software update coming soon?Bose QC Ultra headphones are superior for ANC, comfortable wearing, and sound clarity.Read more; QC Ultras are being quoted as Bose’s best ANC headphones to date.

Whether I’m listening to music, podcasts, or watching movies, the audio experience is immersive and rich. The noise cancellation feature is incredible, creating a near-silent environment no matter where you are.Comfort: These headphones are extremely comfortable for long listening sessions. The ear cups are soft and plush, and the headband is adjustable without feeling too tight. I’ve worn them for hours without any discomfort or pressure on my ears, which is rare for over-ear headphones.Design and Build: The sleek, modern design looks fantastic, and the materials feel premium. The headphones are also lightweight, which makes them easy to carry around in my bag without feeling like a burden. The folding design is a nice touch for compact storage.Battery Life: The battery life is stellar. I’ve been able to use these for multiple days without having to charge them, and when I do charge them, the fast-charging feature is super convenient.Features: The touch controls are intuitive, and the app integration makes adjusting settings a breeze. I also love the customizable noise-cancelling modes, which allow me to tailor the listening experience to my environment.Overall: The Bose QC Ultra has quickly become my go-to headphones for travel, work, and leisure. The combination of sound quality, comfort, and advanced features makes these worth every penny.

Previously, I owned the Sony WH-1000XM3, which was excellent.This model is undoubtedly an upgrade in terms of sound quality, fit, and noise cancellation. However, I did encounter one unusual issue—Bluetooth remained connected for hours even after removing the headphone, instead of disconnecting and entering sleep mode as expected. It happened only once, so it’s hard to say whether it was a firmware glitch or just a rare occurrence. Unfortunately, this did result in some battery drain.I purchased the Bose 60th Anniversary variant for around ₹25,000, which was certainly a great deal.Read more; After using the Bose QuietComfort Ultra for a month while traveling by flight and bus, as well as at home, I’m sharing my review.

La réduction du bruit est juste étonnant, bien au-dessus des AirPods Max, même dans des environnement bruyant assez difficile (vent). Niveau confort, c’est un sans-faute : il est super léger, ne fait pas mal à la tête, même après des heures d’écoute, et s’adapte parfaitement au personne qui porte des lunettes (ce qui n’est pas le cas de tous les casques).Côté son, il y a pas mal de basses a la sortie de boîte mais avec l’égaliseur de l’application (très simple à utiliser), on peut régler ça comme on veut. Résultat : un son riche avec et agréable pour tous les styles de musique, par contre j’ai pas ressenti une grosse différence avec l’Aptx adaptatives et sans et le côté immersion plus artificiel que autre chose. La housse rigide fournie est super pratique, bien meilleure que celles des QC45 ou AirPods Max qui est une blague.Je l’ai aussi testé pour le gaming : nickel en solo, mais à éviter pour les jeux multi à cause d’un petit décalage.

I can be working out at the gym with loads of noise around me, but utilizing the immersive or quiet mode completely shuts off the distracting noise allowing me to focus on my own music and workout. They are high quality and the protective case that comes with it is 10/10. Highly recommend making the switch if you haven't already. Bose is top tier for a reason.Read more; I used to wear Beats By Dre, but these are far superior. The comfort of the headband and ear covers are awesome.

Secondly the battery life is amazing, on a single charge I use this for like 40-45 Hrs and it still doesn't stop! Sound quality is decent in these but it's not cheap at all, tho i would say the durability is below average in these, but it's totally fine for an average user. Most importantly the mic is trash, i bought one of these in 2021 which broke in 2024 so I bought it again in 2024 and in both of the models, the mics did not work and that's the only drawback of this Headphone.Read more; The best headphones in this budget, I'm 6'3 and I have a big skull and ears but these fit perfectly on my head and are very comfortable!

Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is almost fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). It is average in terms of gaming. If you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. You can buy this headphone for games like Minecraft. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.Thank you for reading. Just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.Read more; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition.

Although I am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. There is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. Which is a pity, but ah well. Can't have it all, can ya?Best bluetooth headphones at 799 for sound AND mic quality. And let's not forget comfort. Headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.Although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.Even though I have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  Even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. So if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these. But if you don't mind going for EARPHONES, then there are many better options available in terms of sound quality.Read more; Surprisingly exceeded my expectations.

The wire quality is not upto the mark (3/5), you have to handle it carefully and the earbuds are made of plastic material.Also the the button in the microphone is not at all useful, sometimes it works only to stop ongoing songs but you can't increase or decrease the volume.Overall I'll give it 4✨under the price I bought.An important suggestion:-If you find this product under the range of ₹200.And dont want to go for some high rate earhones, just go for it. It would be a good product to you. Otherwise, you can check out for some other earphones under 500.Some of them are boat or MI earphones and boult audio bass earphones. 👍Hope this will be helpful for you guys.🙂Read more; It's been about 3 months, since I am using this earphone and trust me these will meet upto your expectations.

Worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. Cuz I needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.3.Comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .4.Sturdiness and Build quality.5.Looks obviously , pictures were good but I didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.Quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.Now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. NOT A SINGLE CONCERN WAS FOUNDED TO BE TRUE.1.Mic is working absolutely fine. You can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. If you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. Now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). For all other purposes its perfect.2.I received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am I switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. It has been playing non stop. Its perfect. If you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. You don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). Battery life is sufficient. I haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. Anyway , by what I've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. Firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. Very comfortable. Its definitely over the ears and Completely covers them. Even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. Also , I dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , I've seen heavier gaming headphones. Don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .4.Build quality is very nice , Sturdy and strong. The speakers are tightly held with the band and while I don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. It loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . The RGB looks so beautiful and catchy. The overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . Is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. Everything is perfect. Though I wish now that I should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... It would've looked cooler with RGB.6. With Bluetooth , its justt Awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. Though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠Ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ I Like It (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). I don't play games so I can't talk bout Latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. Now talking bout the wired mode. It Might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. The clarity is just perfect and No latency ofcourse. No need of battery in aux mode. Can keep using it even if the battery is dead. I Like this feature so much. For a student like me , its a charmer. No unnecessary breaks . And With the full sound ☠️ You won't hear even if someone's getting murderrred in the next room ☠️ Its that awesome.  Sound does leak , but its tooo loud as well. I mean , its like a freakin mini speaker on medium volume when you keep it aside and max the volume. It is crazyyyy . You can just hang it on your neck if it gets too hot n you'll still hear everything.It is honestly my very first Wireless headphones. But I have used Boat Rockerz which my friend has , And I can say without a doubt , Giving 200 more for this one is definitely worth it.The comfort , the looks , the loudness , the RGB (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). I even got 129 cashback so it had to be a steal deal for me 😁.I'm so glad I bought this as my first headphones. I was very skeptical but now that I'm using it 😍 , Its just a wonderful experience.Most negative comments I believe are one in hundred Instances or anomaly or exceptions. Most people DON'T review a product till it's defective. Only very few people review when the product it perfect.This is to help first timers like me or for anyone who want a good headphone.Don't worry bout anything , just go for it. Luck can be bad sometimes nd you might get a bad piece , just get it replaced nd voila , problems solved. Its not like 100% of manufactured products are bad ☠️. Anyway. Ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.Read more; The media could not be loaded.Before receiving the product, these were my concerns:-1. alot of reviews were bout how the mic is bad , hence I was concerned.2. Worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. Cuz I needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.3.Comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .4.Sturdiness and Build quality.5.Looks obviously , pictures were good but I didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.Quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.Now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. NOT A SINGLE CONCERN WAS FOUNDED TO BE TRUE.1.Mic is working absolutely fine. You can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. If you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. Now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). For all other purposes its perfect.2.I received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am I switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. It has been playing non stop. Its perfect. If you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. You don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). Battery life is sufficient. I haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. Anyway , by what I've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. Firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. Very comfortable. Its definitely over the ears and Completely covers them. Even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. Also , I dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , I've seen heavier gaming headphones. Don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .4.Build quality is very nice , Sturdy and strong. The speakers are tightly held with the band and while I don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. It loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . The RGB looks so beautiful and catchy. The overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . Is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. Everything is perfect. Though I wish now that I should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... It would've looked cooler with RGB.6.

Ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.; Great Budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together. Great build quality. Great fit can put straight for 2 to 3 hours, after it might feel a bit discomfort, depends on person to person. Great battery, brand claims 40hr and i get too around 38 to 39hr in it which says its approved for long hours. Very good sound quality, if you are confused between two headphones in this budget and you like BASS more, then pick this one it has great bass. So everything is good, but there is one major, very big problem which is kinda aceeptable for someone and not for a lot of pepole. The problem is Sound leakage, if you listen even above 50% vol or for some songs even at 30% vol, the sound starts to get outside earphone. your experience won't get bad for urself but the outsiders could also hear it which is why its not good to use it in public. if u go on 90% volume, rather than a headphone it becomes a speaker, u won't face any problem in ears, but voice outside will come loud easily hearable. It means brand gave everything, but could not block the speakers towards the outer end meaning voice gets outside easilyRead more; Great Budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together.

I got it for a nice deal (approx. Rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). I was reviewing multiple headphones under the Rs. 5k range. My first choice was the Sony CH-520, but I did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and I didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under Rs. 5k). The other options were Boat, Zebronics (a different set), Hammer and a variety of other ones.Among them I did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. I wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. It was available at a reasonable price and the RGB lights impressed me. So I ordered them.PROS:- Sounds good! I'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. No issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. The bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- Sturdy. The headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. While laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. I have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. They are still in good shape- RGB. The lights are definitely funky. They look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- Battery. Applaudable battery without hesitation. I use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.CONS:- Mic. I've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. My peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what I just said- Huge cushions and ear muffs! The size of the muffs are simply too big. When traveling with the headphones on in buses, I like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. But this is simply not possibly with these headphones. The muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. When I try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. So I'm forced to sit rigid for a while- Terrible button placement. The power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. This makes it very hard to use the controls. I have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. It's so ridiculous that I stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- Bad USB-C connection slot. The USB-C connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other USB-C wires because it has a narrow deep opening. So my phone's USB-C charger doesn't fit in it. Only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. This means I always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackOverall decent pair. In my previous (edited now) review, I mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. After several days I realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. So, I have edited my review and updated the ratingCheers!Read more; 3.5/5I have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. I got it for a nice deal (approx.

Buy it it's an amazing product. 7.1 surround is very good.Value for money. Just buy it.; I have been using these headphones for a week now with daily usage of about 10hrs and one thing that i can confidently say is that i did not feel any sort of discomfort or pain in the surrounding areas of the ears even after long hours of gaming, that's great. The sound itself is good for a headphone at this price, slightly on the basy side, however the 7.1 surround which they provide with these headphones i found them a gimmick imho, like i didn't find much difference with it being on or off, tested in competitive games like pubg, valo and cs. footsteps, gunshots and directional sounds were clear and accurate even with the 7.1 surround off. One reason that i might feel such way is that i use nahimic as my primary sound software and eq. and i have surround enabled in there.As for music, the sound quality is good enough.The only thing which i don't like about this headphone is its cable. Firstly its thin and short, though you get the splitter cable along with it which can increase the overall length but who wants to use a splitter?! especially when the splitter itself is even thinner.Read more; I have been using these headphones for a week now with daily usage of about 10hrs and one thing that i can confidently say is that i did not feel any sort of discomfort or pain in the surrounding areas of the ears even after long hours of gaming, that's great.

These headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.Let's start with the build quality. Imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. They weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. Yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.Now, I'm a reasonable person. Accidents happen. So, I contacted NOISE support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. What I got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. They dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).So, here I am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. The audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. My advice? Steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. Unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.For those seeking a more constructive alternative:Do your research! Read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.Prioritize build quality. Look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.Understand the warranty terms thoroughly. Don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.Remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. Choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.Read more; I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS.

"OnePlus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Earphones with Mic, Bombastic Bass, 10 Mins Charge - 20 Hrs Music, 30 Hrs Battery Life (Acoustic Red)","₹1,599",4.1,B0B3MNYGTW,https://www.amazon.in/Oneplus-Bluetooth-Wireless-Earphones-Bombastic/dp/B0B3MNYGTW/ref=sr_1_70?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.b0XOfUpCdRtLkd9Im-O2KuR6FrqF05OesLp_LjoqEaZ5k1zd7rQkEkHMVvBZ4dQHBU2krhaQz6tyH5_ItMVokd7mB5urmhGlM757hbhyN1U2H9nEUgyWuQl7VdHpdwXBSJ3ql7GIarcqbWoIu9Jx-gAH7170S7R8Xa1n5gF_ksqy_Vc0kQFmxgpgP2OtghVhz7csA7nyZhmsAC5J3XLxPm4rTkiBeQGY4f3Vjv1EV-U.GgFGFmIiZob08OuR9W-XZGCq75MOZUBnkFmniJdurYM&dib_tag=se&keywords=headphones&qid=1747130623&sr=8-70,"If you're on the lookout for a solid pair of wireless earphones, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 might just catch your eye. I've been using them for a while, and here's my honest take on what they have to offer.Connectivity & Ease of Use:Let’s start with one of the essentials—connectivity. The OnePlus Bullets Z2 nails it with seamless Bluetooth connectivity that just works. Pairing them with my phone was as simple as it gets, and once connected, they stay that way without any annoying drops. The button placement on the neckband is intuitive, and after a day or two of use, I could easily control playback without needing to glance down, thanks to muscle memory. It’s the kind of convenience you don’t realize you need until you have it.Sound Quality - Balanced Yet Personal:Now, onto the sound quality. As someone who values a balanced sound signature, I found the Z2 to be a great match for my taste. Whether I'm listening to some mellow jazz, electronic beats, or even rock, the sound remains well-rounded and crisp. The highs, mids, and lows don't overpower each other, making it perfect for those who don't want their ears blasted with bass or overwhelmed by treble.That said, sound quality is a subjective experience, and preferences can vary widely. If you're a bass head looking for those earth-shaking lows, you might find these a tad restrained. But if, like me, you appreciate a balanced output across genres, these will hit the right notes for you.Battery Life & Quick Charging - A Week of Peace:Battery life is another highlight. With moderate use—think about 1-2 hours daily—you can stretch a single charge to last an entire week. Even if you’re a heavy listener, using them for 6-8 hours straight, they can hold up for around 2-3 days before needing a recharge. And the quick charge feature is a lifesaver—just 10 minutes of charging gets you 2-4 hours of extra playtime, which is perfect for those “oops, I forgot to charge them” moments.Gaming & Low Latency - Smooth Experience:I spend a fair bit of time playing games like BGMI, and the low latency mode on the Bullets Z2 makes a noticeable difference. There's minimal lag between the visuals and the audio, which makes for a much more immersive gaming experience. It's not just about the sound being clear; it's also about it being on time, and these earphones deliver that pretty well.Comfort & Passive Noise Isolation:Comfort is key when it comes to neckbands, and the Z2 doesn’t disappoint. They come with multiple earbud sizes, so you can pick the one that fits snugly for you. While there’s no active noise cancellation (ANC) here, you can achieve a decent level of passive noise isolation by choosing the right ear tips. This makes a noticeable difference in cutting out background noise during commutes or at the office.App Experience & Annoying Blinking Light:Now, onto a couple of quirks. The Bullets Z2 uses the HeyMelody app, which offers additional features like custom sound settings. However, my unit just wouldn’t connect with the app, which was a bummer. So, any fancy tweaks you could make through the app were out of my reach, and I had to rely solely on the default Bluetooth pairing. While everything worked smoothly once connected, I feel like I missed out on some customization options that might have enhanced my experience.Another thing that bugged me was the small white light that blinks when the neckband is connected to a device. It might not seem like a big deal, but if you’re using the earphones in a dark room or while lying down, that blinking light can be pretty distracting. Plus, it probably drains the battery a bit, albeit a small amount. A simple option to turn this off in the app would’ve been a nice touch.Final Thoughts - A Solid Pick for Most, with Room for Improvement:Overall, the OnePlus Z2 delivers where it matters—good sound quality, reliable connectivity, and battery life that won’t have you constantly reaching for the charger. It’s not perfect, especially with the blinking light and app connectivity issues, but those are minor compared to the solid performance it offers. Plus, with the quick-charge feature and low-latency gaming experience, it’s hard not to appreciate the value you get.If you’re looking for a reliable neckband that blends style, comfort, and balanced audio, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 is definitely worth considering. It might not satisfy those who crave earth-shattering bass, but for most listeners, it's a worthy contender at its price point.Read more; If you're on the lookout for a solid pair of wireless earphones, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 might just catch your eye. I've been using them for a while, and here's my honest take on what they have to offer.Connectivity & Ease of Use:Let’s start with one of the essentials—connectivity. The OnePlus Bullets Z2 nails it with seamless Bluetooth connectivity that just works. Pairing them with my phone was as simple as it gets, and once connected, they stay that way without any annoying drops. The button placement on the neckband is intuitive, and after a day or two of use, I could easily control playback without needing to glance down, thanks to muscle memory. It’s the kind of convenience you don’t realize you need until you have it.Sound Quality - Balanced Yet Personal:Now, onto the sound quality. As someone who values a balanced sound signature, I found the Z2 to be a great match for my taste. Whether I'm listening to some mellow jazz, electronic beats, or even rock, the sound remains well-rounded and crisp. The highs, mids, and lows don't overpower each other, making it perfect for those who don't want their ears blasted with bass or overwhelmed by treble.That said, sound quality is a subjective experience, and preferences can vary widely. If you're a bass head looking for those earth-shaking lows, you might find these a tad restrained. But if, like me, you appreciate a balanced output across genres, these will hit the right notes for you.Battery Life & Quick Charging - A Week of Peace:Battery life is another highlight. With moderate use—think about 1-2 hours daily—you can stretch a single charge to last an entire week. Even if you’re a heavy listener, using them for 6-8 hours straight, they can hold up for around 2-3 days before needing a recharge. And the quick charge feature is a lifesaver—just 10 minutes of charging gets you 2-4 hours of extra playtime, which is perfect for those “oops, I forgot to charge them” moments.Gaming & Low Latency - Smooth Experience:I spend a fair bit of time playing games like BGMI, and the low latency mode on the Bullets Z2 makes a noticeable difference. There's minimal lag between the visuals and the audio, which makes for a much more immersive gaming experience. It's not just about the sound being clear; it's also about it being on time, and these earphones deliver that pretty well.Comfort & Passive Noise Isolation:Comfort is key when it comes to neckbands, and the Z2 doesn’t disappoint. They come with multiple earbud sizes, so you can pick the one that fits snugly for you. While there’s no active noise cancellation (ANC) here, you can achieve a decent level of passive noise isolation by choosing the right ear tips.

It might not satisfy those who crave earth-shattering bass, but for most listeners, it's a worthy contender at its price point.; There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking. They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.The earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating.Pairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.You get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.As for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.If you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.That said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.They come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.The Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass.Read more; There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking.

The fit is good and the design is nice in my opinion, very slim and light weight. Despite the magnetic connection of the earbuds being the only way to power down the device this has not been an issue, they snap together and power down flawlessly. They are comfortable and the connection is the fastest I've ever seen and they connect to my S24 within a few seconds after separating the magnetic backs of the earbuds. Sound quality is decent, but the price and functionality has surpassed expectations as I've been using them for over 5 months and I've only had to charge them maybe once every other week for like 30 minutes.Read more; Bought these for the 2-3 hours a week I am at the gym and the battery life is good.

The headphones are simply awesome bang for the buck. I purchased them from 3200 from Amazon and got the delivery in 2 days since the 2 day shipping was available. This review is being posted after about 2 weeks of usage.Dividing the Review into Pros and Cons -Pros1. Excellent Soundstage.2. Brilliant Clarity. Each instrument can be heard clearly and you will hear sounds that you never heard before.3. Build Quality is sturdy and premium materials have been used. Considering that M20x are the starting range of the Audio Technica Headphone, i have to say they have done a really good job. Premium materials have been used, the foam at the top of the band and around the ear cups is of really good quality.Cons1. The wire is really long and while this can be a pro as well since it gives the ability to move around i would have like a shorter wire and preferably a detachable wire as is provided with the 40x and other models higher up in the range2. They are big ! Not something that will be very easy to carry around and i rely on by earphones for taking along in my laptop bag. These are meant to be enjoyed at home for me. When worn properly your entire ears will fit in the ear cups. And this provided excellent sound quality and noise isolation. However, the size will need getting used to and now after 2 weeks i do not feel that awkward and am able to enjoy them despite the huge size.3. Your ears will sweat since they are in the ear cups and while they cannot be worn for long intervals - that is more than 30 minutes at the start. Once you get used to them - after about 2 weeks and when sitting in an AC room you can easily listen to them for hours. The sound quality is so good that once you are accustomed to the size you enjoy them immensely.At the end i would like to say that these are something that every music lover should have ! Yes, the sound quality is so good ! I listened to all sorts of music on these and i have to say that when used with an equalizer they are especially good. I personally use an App called ""Power Amp"" on Android, which works great. Than i also listen to a lot of Wynk and You Tube for which an app called ""Bass Equalizer"" does a really good job. This app will work with online music, that is the beauty of it.The headphones have a lot of bass, their inbuilt signature is flat and for bass lovers, when used with the apps i mentioned they give sufficient bass. The music that excels the most on these headphones is live music, like MTV unplugged. And Acoustic music where guitars and Cellos are used.In a nutshell, if you primarily listen to music on earphones since they are so much more convenient and easy to carry than these will be a revelation for you.Read more; This is one of the best purchases i have made in recent times.

This is an absolute best purchase you can have on a budget(I know what you think..though I said budget but I had to save up for three months to buy this for 4.5k INR. But compared to other studio monitor headphones and the sound quality youre getting for this price is just undeniable). I sincerely disagree with every single comments out there saying this doesn't have bass. If you're an avid listener and who listen to a lot of flac then you'll understand once you listen to this. So go for it.Even though they said it's flat sound but I could already feel decent amount of bass without changing any eq settings. If you want true flat sound I would say sennheiser is the choice. I have used sennheiser and Sony and this would come in the middle of both when it comes to bass but the sound quality is crisp af and top notch. And yes it does work great for movies too...I haven't played games much with this apart from one or two times.. and the wire is indeed quite long as mentioned in many other reviews...it can be a plus or minus depending on your purpose..for me it's okay as I sometimes use it with full length at home and I barely took it outside. But you can coil it up and use some velcro tape which I do sometimes..initially I felt it little bit tighter which is common for every headphones and as I have a big head but that was changed as I got used to it and it loosen up little bit and now fits perfectly without any discomfort which I experienced in the first two months.The only two drawbacks for me so far is that..one is the cushions tends to get your ears sweaty if you live in hot n humid place like mine. But inside an air conditioned room that wouldn't be much of an issue. Second thing is the small wire that goes between the headband and speakers on both side...that I felt like a poor design choice and gives me anxiety manytimes that if I'll break it somehow.Read more; 5 ⭐ for sound quality 4⭐ because of the comfort.Writing after 6 months of usage.

With these headphones, I realized for the first time in my life that not all songs are recorded the same way, which makes me truly appreciate their sound quality.I genuinely feel these headphones are a gem in this budget, and even offer great value compared to higher-tier options. If they prove to be durable, Sennheiser has just earned one more loyal customer.Sorry if my English isn’t perfect—this is my first time writing a review!; At this moment, you don't want to hurt your ear with overpowered bass.It is direct competitor of Sony ULT WEAR. But Utl wear is predecessor of Sony WH-XB910N, it was known for extreme bass. Extreme! yes, it will actually start dancing on your head.My vision was clear, I had been searching for an over the ear headphones for multi-purpose use. (Music, office-meeting, YouTube-content watch/listening on PC and Phone).Don't like:1. Sennheiser smart control is really bad. Bass-booster is just useless. Don't fall for this marketing gimmick. Tips: Don't believe YouTube review videos blindly. All are doing business. I read some reviews from the internet. Even some Reddit users told the truth about this headphone.2. I couldn't turn off touch control of this headphone.3. I couldn't find any way to control Equalizer from PC. (Will talk about the Dolby Access in What I liked part)Do Like:1. Design2. Cushions are totally air locked. On transparency mode you will start listening to extra sound.3. my use case: 70% time I use it with PC, in this area it is just performing like a charm.4. With Dolby Access (paid version. Cost 1000-1200 INR for lifetime), enhanced the power of this headphone by 300% (yes, 3 times compared to mobile), shared screenshot, with only 18% sound this performance is equivalent to 60% of mobile devices.5. Dolby Atmos on Phone: With this application other headphone were failed to perform well. But Sennheiser Accentum Plus has the ability.6. When you have Dolby Atmos on phone, and Dolby access on PC, you only need good balanced headphone. Here Sennheiser Accentum Plus stand out.If our devices are failed to produce good sound, then we cannot blame the headphone only!conclusion: If you like to hear good music, not super bassy song, then simply go for it. Low-mid-high, in every area it is just Awesome.for ANC part, you can believe the youtubers, ANC works fine under flat/continuous incoming sound (under 80-90 Db).point to note: Produce 3 times extra sound with type c port.In single stretch I can easily use it for long 3 hours, no headache, no pain behind the ear, no overhead pain I felt.(queries) Insta id: pritam16rahaRead more; At this moment, you don't want to hurt your ear with overpowered bass.It is direct competitor of Sony ULT WEAR.

Ook telefoneren is fantastisch met deze koptelefoon!Top product!; Premesso che utilizzo queste cuffie in combinazione con le JBL tour one m2, trovate a 200 euro (non prendetele a di più perché a quel punto non c'è storia con le Sennheiser Momentum 4) e quindi più o meno nella stessa fascia di prezzo di queste Sennheiser Accentum Plus. Su internet, specie se masticate un po' di inglese, trovate già confronti e recensioni, quindi mi limito a dire la mia.La custodia delle Sennheiser è softschells ai lati, offre meno sicurezza rispetto quella della JBL ma è anche molto meno ingombrante. Le Accentum plus in sé offrono un sensazione ""plasticosa"" sui padiglioni esterni, ma questo si traduce in una grande leggerezza e comfort. Mentre i cuscinetti, l'archetto con l'imbottitura e la regolazione sono assolutamente di livello, superiori alle JBL. Anche i controlli touch sono superiori per sensibilità e flessibilità di utilizzo. I microfoni sono buoni e fanno i loro ma se le usate per tante calls valutate le JBL che ne hanno di più (4 a 7) e sembrano funzionare meglio.Se veniamo al suono qui è quesione di gusti. Nominalmente le Accentum Plus hanno driver più piccoli delle Tour one M2 ma dispongono dei codec apt adaptive e hd mentre le altre no. E il ""signature sennheiser sound"" non è solo pubblicità:i bassi sono molto corposi e le voci risultano sempre molto chiare e il suono arriva molto bene al piacere di ascolto. Per i miei gusti sono migliori delle JBL, che pure hanno un ottimo suono che però privilegia altre frequenze, ma dipende dalle proprie preferenze. L'equalizzatore e la personalizzazione suono che l'app offre sono basiche, quindi dipende molto da cosa cercate. Per una cuffia che fa dell'audio il suo punto forte mi aspettavo più possibilità da questo punto di vista. Le JBL offrono molte più funzionalità e personalizzazione lato software, come ad esempio la funzione smartalk, che attiva la modalità trasparenza se sente che parlate con qualcuno.Sulla carta le JBL hanno una connessione Bluetooth più avanzata, ma ho trovato la connessione multipoint molto più stabile e a suo agio nei passaggi tra i dispositivi sulle Accentum plus.L'ANC lavora bene sulle accentum, non è elite ma fa il suo. Probabilmente le JBL fanno leggermente meglio.Quindi, per me sui 150 - 180 euro le accentum plus per me sono ottime cuffie che mi sento di consigliare anche rispetto le tour one m2. Specie se conoscete e apprezzate il suono sennheiser, la loro qualità audio è superiore e mi sono sembrate molto più stabili e rifinite delle JBL. Se invecete l'audio vi interessa relativamente andate con le altre che comunque hanno anche un ottimo audio.Read more; Premesso che utilizzo queste cuffie in combinazione con le JBL tour one m2, trovate a 200 euro (non prendetele a di più perché a quel punto non c'è storia con le Sennheiser Momentum 4) e quindi più o meno nella stessa fascia di prezzo di queste Sennheiser Accentum Plus.

I got the order today and the package is good without any damage. But the issue is with the earphones. The left earbud is producing static noise and the sound is low compared to right side. It's not like it started after a few days or months. It started on same day as I received the order and just a few minutes after I started using. I don't know if everyone is facing this issue (saw similar comments on YouTube and reviews) but this is causing very bad hearing experience. I assume it may be due to driver issue or wiring in left side. Request to please take note of this feedback for both buyers and the boat companyRead more; I purchased Boat Rockerz 255 Z Plus.

It's not like it started after a few days or months. It started on same day as I received the order and just a few minutes after I started using. I don't know if everyone is facing this issue (saw similar comments on YouTube and reviews) but this is causing very bad hearing experience. I assume it may be due to driver issue or wiring in left side. Request to please take note of this feedback for both buyers and the boat company; Fone de excelente qualidade! Som limpo e agradável.

Tem bateria muito durável. Meu interesse maior era para usar com o capacete da moto e ficou ótimo. Consigo prestar atenção nos ruídos do trânsito, o ruído do motor da moto não interfere no som. Não cai do ouvido quando tiro o capacete, era muito recorrente o fone cair com outros modelos.Fixa bem no ouvido, não desloca. Tem bom nível de volume e qualidade de som. Estou muito satisfeito com o produto.Parece ser bem resistente. Espero que seja durável, mas isso só o tempo vai dizer.Read more; É O melhor fone wireless que já comprei. Tem bateria muito durável.

I’ll say as a successor to the XB series this one definitely is a level above. At Ult 2 mode, the increase in bass, even though it’s significant amount of bass, does not make the overall sound mushy or reduces the clarity that you hear when Ult is off. I like it, even heavy metal sounds good with Ult on. I’d say apart from sound, battery is the second most impressive point about this product. I easily get one entire week out of 5-6 hours use daily. The app is good, you have more than enough customisation capabilities. The hard case is of good quality, this headphone is not at all compact by any means, so the storage method is twisting it to a very specific position to get it inside the case, which can be tricky and might even break the stems as this is a all plastic product, but overall the case is smaller due to that reason and no issue, you’ll get the hang of it after a week. I use the audio jack when using with playstation, just plug it into the controller 3.5 mm port and sound is really good with fit that is comfortable for hours of gaming, that does not consume headphone battery as well. ANC is like 8/10 quality, but I guess someone who hasn’t used apple airpods pro gen 2 before can easily say this is a great headphone with ANC considering its a headphone and not a earphone. I use transparency/ambient mode mostly, which is a solid 10! You can even control how much amount of outside noise you’ll want to pass on to your ears from the app, which you can’t in apple.Read more; Been using this headphone for over 6 months now.

Im a basic audio enthusiast and an avid music lover.. My personal taste of audio is a mixed one.. I waited so long and after many years Sony ultimately launched this ULT headphone that perfectly fits my taste of music.. I usually prefer only headphones for listening music and watching movies as they completely cover up your ears and drives powerful audio straight to your sealed ears.. That is a different experience than the in ear or TWS ones.. And I definitely need BASS without any compromise on mid section, the highs, sound to be rich, clean with decent stereo staging.. This one satisfies all that.. I do use EQ to tweak settings for my taste and once setup, hell yeah it is just out of the world!! I dont understand why many reviews downplay music quality like mids, highs, crispness, stereo staging etc but this one does all that with that massive bass too!! Either there are headphones with rich audio clarity but lacks on bass or there are the other bassy ones that makes other aspects sound trash.. But this one for me is an all rounder.. Music which has only rich vocals, string sections without much bass lines too sound soo good same as music with immersive bass.. By bass I dont mean just the upper bass which gives you headache but the really low end rumbles extending deeper to sub 20Hz or even less which you can actually feel.. I feel like Im in an IMAX theatre or somewhere straight into the studios after I put this up.. Even for ppl who dont like bass there is an option to completely switch it off.. For me it works wonders with the first ULT mode.. That is damn impressive.. Everyone whom I asked to listen this was just blown away.. I really love it..I have tried many brands like Sennheiser Momentum plus (diaphragm distortion) even at moderate volume so returned back, then JBL not satisfied with audio quality though had bass, then some new companies like SonicLamb which fakes the bass (No bass less than 40Hz or so but will fake with some artificial vibrations) which I threw to trash.. Finally this is the real and clean one for my budget..I don't even look into Noise cancelling as I mostly listen music only indoors but this actually does a pretty good job and silences the outer noise by almost half.. Most of the times I don't even need it indoors..Likewise i rarely make calls with this but that is pretty good as well..Bluetooth connection and latency is fine for me as I'm not gamer.. Connection is very stable and it can connect two devices at once..Battery is also pretty good so as the charging time..If I have to speak about some cons, the headphone always runs with noise cancelling mode on by default even if you toggle it through headphone control.. Ambient noise mode off does not actually turn off, but the mics work even harder to amplify external noises so that you can hear everything around.. Everytime you have to get the app running and set like while detecting as 'Staying' then completely turn off noise cancelling feature.. As a person who is not interested much on this aspect I don't have to put this extra load to the headphone and I have to switch it off manually through the app everytime..And I also prefer the headphones to be more louder.. Some movies or videos have very low volume and even at highest volume it's not loud enough..But these are manageable and overall I think Sony really nailed with this headphone..!!Read more; These headphones are just bang for the bucks!!

When it comes to the sound quality that's beyond my expectation. I'm completely satisfied with the sound quality and bass. Though this product is specially for bass lovers you can adjust bass level and also use Equalizer for music control in the sound connect app by sony. So, this product is not only for bass lovers and also for a music lovers. Battery life is too good. I use it for 4-5 hours a day but I charge this product every 10 days so battery backup is good. Comfort is too good. I'm using this product for past 15 days and there is no discomfort or any pain in my ears. Only problem is sometimes I noted is as it covers your ear so you might get sweat in ears. If you use it in AC room no chance for sweat. So this is what I experienced using this product. Hope this experience might help others to take decision.Read more; Overall quality of the product is good and worth the money. When it comes to the sound quality that's beyond my expectation.

One of the best things about these headphones is the 70-hour battery life. I don’t have to worry about charging them daily, which is a big plus. Even after long hours of listening, they still have plenty of battery. The low latency mode (up to 45ms) makes a noticeable difference while gaming or watching videos. There is no delay between the sound and the visuals, making the experience smooth and enjoyable. This feature is especially useful for gamers who need real-time audio feedback. With dual pairing, I can connect the headphones to two devices at the same time, which is super convenient. I can easily switch between my phone and laptop without having to disconnect and reconnect. The Bluetooth v5.3 ensures a stable and fast connection with no interruptions.The Carbon Black finish looks stylish and premium. The ear cushions are soft and comfortable, making them easy to wear for long hours without discomfort. They are also lightweight, which is great for travel or extended use.I’m really happy with my purchase of the Noise 3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones. They provide excellent sound, long battery life, and smooth connectivity at a reasonable price. If you’re looking for a reliable and stylish pair of wireless headphones, this is a great choice.Would definitely recommend! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐; I recently got the Noise 3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones, and overall, I’m impressed. The sound quality is fantastic with rich bass and clear highs, thanks to the 40mm drivers. The low latency of up to 45ms is great for gaming or watching videos, ensuring no audio delay. With Bluetooth 5.3, the connection is stable and reliable, and the dual pairing feature is super convenient, allowing me to connect to two devices at once. The 70-hour playtime is incredible, meaning I don’t have to worry about charging often. However, the only downside is the comfort of the ear cushions. While they provide decent padding, they aren’t as comfortable as I had hoped, especially for long listening sessions. They could be softer and more cushioned to offer a better overall experience. Despite this, the sound quality and features make these headphones a great value for the price.Read more; I recently got the Noise 3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones, and overall, I’m impressed.

The finish is solid and stylish.Comfort: Major issue – the ear cups start hurting within 20-30 minutes. They’re tight and feel sharp around the ears, not suitable for long use.Sound Quality: Just average. Bass is weak, vocals are flat, and overall sound is not immersive. Definitely not for music lovers or gamers.Battery Backup: Good battery life, but what’s the use if you can’t wear it comfortably?Latency: Claimed 45ms low latency – works fine for casual YouTube videos, but not ideal for fast-paced gaming.Verdict:Great looks, poor comfort, and average sound.

Amazing battery backup I only need to charge it once per week and I listen to music atleast 2 hrs everyday. The sound quality is great but you may need to use equilizers to adjust the bass since this one is specially designed for high bass. My OnePlus already provides different mode of audio settings depends on the use so no trouble for me. Durability is amazing. I dropped it 2 times from 5 ft and nothing happened not even a scratch but if you sit on it , it will break for sure. It's not water proof by the way, it can resist small drops of liquids whether sweat or water but I won't recommend these for gym . And it's on ear not over ear headphones. Prolonged use can hurt back of your ears.Read more; Bought this 3 months ago, am totally impressed.

Noise partnering with Bose for sound tuning really shows in the final product. I honestly didn't expect this level of sound quality from an Indian brand in this price range, but the audio clarity and balance are top-notch. The bass feels deep without overpowering, mids are clean, and the highs are crisp. Whether you're listening to music or watching a movie, the sound feels immersive and natural.The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is another highlight — it can cut out a surprising amount of background noise. Noise claims up to 49dB of noise cancellation, and while I haven't measured it, the performance feels on par with some higher-end earbuds. Even in crowded environments, the buds block out most distractions, making them perfect for travel or work.The design is sleek and minimal, with a comfortable fit that doesn't cause ear fatigue even after hours of use. The touch controls are responsive, and I love how you can customize them through the Noise Audio App.Battery life is impressive too — I got close to the claimed 44 hours with the case, and the buds last around 8 hours on a single charge. The dual device pairing feature is super convenient, letting me switch between my laptop and phone without any hassle.Overall, the Noise Master Buds feel like a big step forward for Indian audio brands. With Bose's tuning and solid features like ANC, spatial audio, and LDHC support, they easily compete with more expensive options.Read more; The Noise Master Buds genuinely surprised me — and in the best way possible.

The battery life is also impressive.; I recently purchased the Noise Master Buds from Amazon and overall, I'm quite satisfied with the experience. The retro-inspired design is stylish and the earbuds fit comfortably, though they are slightly bulky. Sound quality is solid with 12.4mm titanium drivers delivering balanced audio across highs and mids, though treble can get a bit sharp at higher volumes. The Active Noise Cancellation (up to 49dB) works impressively well, especially in office and commuting environments. Battery life is another strong point, offering up to 50 hours with the case and a quick charge feature that’s super handy. Indoor call quality is great, but outdoor performance struggles with background noise. However, the build quality feels a bit plasticky and the case is on the larger side, which doesn’t quite match the premium price tag. Considering all this, I find the product slightly overpriced for what it offers, but still a solid choice for everyday use. I’m giving it 4 out of 5 stars.Read more; I recently purchased the Noise Master Buds from Amazon and overall, I'm quite satisfied with the experience.

I've ordered some extra cups too for later down the line when I will eventually need new ones (all cups for all headsets wear over time)Adding the new cups was amazing, it felt like I had a brand new headset again!; 頭小さめで特に横幅が狭いのですが、伸ばさずに使ってちょうど良かったです！遮音性が高いので周りの雑音が気にならず、臨場感(立体感)がありお気に入りです。音の設定をしていない状態だとあまり低音が響く感じではなく、ライブ会場で聞く音のようなバランスの良いタイプかなと感じました。Read more; 頭小さめで特に横幅が狭いのですが、伸ばさずに使ってちょうど良かったです！遮音性が高いので周りの雑音が気にならず、臨場感(立体感)がありお気に入りです。音の設定をしていない状態だとあまり低音が響く感じではなく、ライブ会場で聞く音のようなバランスの良いタイプかなと感じました。; La qualité est incroyable ! le son est crispy, le casque est juste parfait, je pourrais vous écrire 40 lignes pour vous dire toutes les choses positives mais ça ne sert a rien car le casque remplis parfaitement son rôle.Read more; La qualité est incroyable ! le son est crispy, le casque est juste parfait, je pourrais vous écrire 40 lignes pour vous dire toutes les choses positives mais ça ne sert a rien car le casque remplis parfaitement son rôle.; Le Sennheiser HD 450BT sono davvero una bella scoperta.

Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is almost fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). It is average in terms of gaming. If you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. You can buy this headphone for games like Minecraft. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.Thank you for reading.

Although I am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. There is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. Which is a pity, but ah well. Can't have it all, can ya?Best bluetooth headphones at 799 for sound AND mic quality. And let's not forget comfort. Headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.Although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.Even though I have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  Even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. So if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these.

These days we are overwhelmed with so many brands and earphones and it's difficult to find the best value for money deal. Now I am not saying these are best but on comfort level it's excellent. You cannnot expect to get very thumping bass but they produce decent punchy bass even after being an over ear type earbuds. Voice clarity is pretty good. The treble and instruments seperation is also good but not too good which is justified given the price of this product. You can work, listen music, play games and wear at the gym and you never have to worry losing it from ears. Next best thing is the app controls and the customisation options in the app which is very neat and easy to do. Best part and the most distinguished feature of this buds is the lights. Oh man those are great attractive and you can control the colours and time and mode all in the app. So for sure I bet you that you will be very satisfied with the purchase. This is because I have also purchased both medium brands like Beat, Mivi, Realme and high end brands like Sony, Samsung and most of them are either lying around unused or i returned them. You may not the ANC feature here as obviously because it's open ear type earbuds. But that's how it is. It can never have an ANC. But rest assured you will experience quality sound and you can express it in style with the lights enabled if you need. That's it. One last thing.

The open-ear style adds to its stylish appeal.However, my expectations for music quality were quite high, and initially, I was disappointed. Being used to premium brands like Sony and JBL, I found the overall sound quality to be average, despite the good bass. Over time, I realized its strength lies in all-around usage rather than just music listening.For calls, podcasts, videos, workouts, and casual listening while staying aware of surroundings, it works well. The touch controls are responsive, and call quality is clear.

However, it’s not the best choice for those seeking a premium music experience.Read more; The media could not be loaded.The Soundcore V20i impressed me with its sleek design, ultra-comfortable fit, and almost weightless feel on the ears. The open-ear style adds to its stylish appeal.However, my expectations for music quality were quite high, and initially, I was disappointed. Being used to premium brands like Sony and JBL, I found the overall sound quality to be average, despite the good bass. Over time, I realized its strength lies in all-around usage rather than just music listening.For calls, podcasts, videos, workouts, and casual listening while staying aware of surroundings, it works well. The touch controls are responsive, and call quality is clear.

I use them every day when I’m working out, or walking, gardening, etc.  I can’t wear the ear pods that go into your ear canal because they always fall out, even with the slightest move of my head.  So I purchased On Ear Headphones which worked out okay, except that were heavy and when I would sweat they would start to slide off my ear and head.  But these Soundcore Open Ear Headphones work perfectly.  They are so lightweight that I hardly feel them on my ear.  They are comfortable and fit snuggly and are adjustable to any angle.  They don’t slide off even when I sweat, and the over-the-ear adjustable ear hooks keep the Headphones in place no matter how rigorous I am working out!  The sound quality is great too.  They were easy to set up and connect with all my devices and the battery lasts.  I’m really happy with these Headphones!Read more; I purchased these Open Ear Headphones a month ago and I love them!

These headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.Let's start with the build quality. Imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. They weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. Yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.Now, I'm a reasonable person. Accidents happen. So, I contacted NOISE support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. What I got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. They dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).So, here I am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. The audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. My advice? Steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. Unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.For those seeking a more constructive alternative:Do your research! Read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.Prioritize build quality. Look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.Understand the warranty terms thoroughly. Don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.Remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. Choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.Read more; I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS.

They’re lightweight too, so you won’t feel like your head’s in a vice, but the build is mostly plastic, which might not feel super premium.🎷 When it comes to sound, they don’t disappoint. You’ll appreciate how the bass hits without drowning out everything else. None of device have LDAC, so i didn't test it 🙃.🔇 The noise-cancelling is pretty solid for the price.

Recommended to customize Equalizer for best effect.3. Can use hearID that sets EQ based on hearing and a few questions. Headphones have in built decibel meter that checks output.4. Sound limiter is a nice touch.5. Sound is a bit laggy in games, recommended for music and occassional calls.6. Sound output won't necessarily cater to all kinds of music, so don't expect to wear them and magically feel great sound.7.

They cater perfectly to all types of listeners, whether you're into deep bass or prefer a more balanced sound. When you activate noise cancellation, the bass becomes more subtle, ideal for those who want clarity and detail. Switch to transparency mode, and the bass gets a nice boost, adding warmth to the music without overpowering. And if you're a fan of bass-heavy tunes, the Bass Boost mode will blow you away—it’s powerful and immersive. These headphones strike a perfect balance, making them worth every penny. Whether it's crisp highs, rich mids, or booming lows, they won't disappoint.Read more; The headphones arrived today, and I must say, the out-of-the-box audio quality is impressive.

Kulaklığın genişliği, kulağı ve başı ağrıtmaması ve seni dünyadan koparan ses işte aradığım kulaklık dedirtti.; Acquistate come regalo (consegna Amazon come sempre perfettamente puntuale nonostante l’elevato volume di spedizioni del periodo festivo) e sono state molto apprezzate.Il design è molto curato e di questo ne beneficia non solo l’estetica ma anche la comodità: al di là dell’eleganza complessiva che risalta subito, all’utilizzo si nota come l’archetto sia molto morbido e i padiglioni abbastanza spaziosi da accogliere l’orecchio senza comunque eccedere nelle dimensioni, non risultando ingombranti.La qualità del suono è adatta alla fascia di prezzo che occupa il prodotto, restando su un buon livello complessivo nonostante non riesca ovviamente a raggiungere la spaziosità del suono offerta da prodotti decisamente più high-end o cuffie aperte, che restituiscono una separazione dei toni sicuramente più accurata incrementando il livello di dettaglio percepibile. Ciononostante è piacevole la possibilità di utilizzare l’app dedicata per apportare modifiche all’equalizzazione, personalizzando quindi l’esperienza d’ascolto secondo le proprie preferenze.La connettività è duplice, sia wireless che cablata, permettendo un rapido e semplice pairing bluetooth per l’utilizzo con dispositivi mobile senza rinunciare -attraverso un cavo con jack 3.5mm presente nella dotazione- alla possibilità di collegare l’headset in wired, ampliando le possibilità di impiego (per esempio, questo consente di connettere le cuffie al controller delle console PS5 ed Xbox Series X/S che non supportano la connessione bluetooth).La cancellazione attiva del rumore fa abbastanza bene il suo dovere, riducendo in maniera sufficientemente efficace i rumori ambientali (anche se non sempre riesce ad annichilirli completamente), ed è presente anche una modalità trasparenza che sebbene non possa competere, per esempio, con quella offerta dalle soluzioni Apple (né è in dovere di farlo, vista la fascia di prezzo in cui si posiziona), permette di ascoltare l’ambiente esterno e consente la comunicazione verbale con un interlocutore. Molto apprezzata la possibilità di switch dalla modalità active noise cancellation a quella trasparenza in tempo reale, possibile sia coprendo uno dei due padiglioni con la mano, sia -attualmente in versione beta attivabile tramite app- attraverso il riconoscimento autonomo della conversazione, con le cuffie che, non appena l’utente che le indossa inizia a parlare, riducono sensibilmente il volume del contenuto in riproduzione e lo ripristinano automaticamente a conversazione conclusa.Read more; Acquistate come regalo (consegna Amazon come sempre perfettamente puntuale nonostante l’elevato volume di spedizioni del periodo festivo) e sono state molto apprezzate.Il design è molto curato e di questo ne beneficia non solo l’estetica ma anche la comodità: al di là dell’eleganza complessiva che risalta subito, all’utilizzo si nota come l’archetto sia molto morbido e i padiglioni abbastanza spaziosi da accogliere l’orecchio senza comunque eccedere nelle dimensioni, non risultando ingombranti.La qualità del suono è adatta alla fascia di prezzo che occupa il prodotto, restando su un buon livello complessivo nonostante non riesca ovviamente a raggiungere la spaziosità del suono offerta da prodotti decisamente più high-end o cuffie aperte, che restituiscono una separazione dei toni sicuramente più accurata incrementando il livello di dettaglio percepibile.

Secondly the battery life is amazing, on a single charge I use this for like 40-45 Hrs and it still doesn't stop! Sound quality is decent in these but it's not cheap at all, tho i would say the durability is below average in these, but it's totally fine for an average user. Most importantly the mic is trash, i bought one of these in 2021 which broke in 2024 so I bought it again in 2024 and in both of the models, the mics did not work and that's the only drawback of this Headphone.Read more; The best headphones in this budget, I'm 6'3 and I have a big skull and ears but these fit perfectly on my head and are very comfortable!

Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is almost fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). It is average in terms of gaming. If you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. You can buy this headphone for games like Minecraft. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.Thank you for reading. Just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.Read more; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition.

Although I am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. There is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. Which is a pity, but ah well. Can't have it all, can ya?Best bluetooth headphones at 799 for sound AND mic quality. And let's not forget comfort. Headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.Although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.Even though I have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  Even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. So if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these. But if you don't mind going for EARPHONES, then there are many better options available in terms of sound quality.Read more; Surprisingly exceeded my expectations.

And volume is too loud 😍Bhaiyo kharid lo awesome product hai.Thankyou noise and Amazon for this best experience.😍; I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS. These headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.Let's start with the build quality. Imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. They weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. Yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.Now, I'm a reasonable person. Accidents happen. So, I contacted NOISE support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. What I got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. They dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).So, here I am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. The audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. My advice? Steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. Unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.For those seeking a more constructive alternative:Do your research! Read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.Prioritize build quality. Look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.Understand the warranty terms thoroughly. Don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.Remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. Choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.Read more; I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS.

Worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. Cuz I needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.3.Comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .4.Sturdiness and Build quality.5.Looks obviously , pictures were good but I didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.Quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.Now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. NOT A SINGLE CONCERN WAS FOUNDED TO BE TRUE.1.Mic is working absolutely fine. You can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. If you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. Now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). For all other purposes its perfect.2.I received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am I switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. It has been playing non stop. Its perfect. If you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. You don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). Battery life is sufficient. I haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. Anyway , by what I've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. Firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. Very comfortable. Its definitely over the ears and Completely covers them. Even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. Also , I dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , I've seen heavier gaming headphones. Don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .4.Build quality is very nice , Sturdy and strong. The speakers are tightly held with the band and while I don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. It loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . The RGB looks so beautiful and catchy. The overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . Is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. Everything is perfect. Though I wish now that I should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... It would've looked cooler with RGB.6. With Bluetooth , its justt Awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. Though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠Ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ I Like It (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). I don't play games so I can't talk bout Latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. Now talking bout the wired mode. It Might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. The clarity is just perfect and No latency ofcourse. No need of battery in aux mode. Can keep using it even if the battery is dead. I Like this feature so much. For a student like me , its a charmer. No unnecessary breaks . And With the full sound ☠️ You won't hear even if someone's getting murderrred in the next room ☠️ Its that awesome.  Sound does leak , but its tooo loud as well. I mean , its like a freakin mini speaker on medium volume when you keep it aside and max the volume. It is crazyyyy . You can just hang it on your neck if it gets too hot n you'll still hear everything.It is honestly my very first Wireless headphones. But I have used Boat Rockerz which my friend has , And I can say without a doubt , Giving 200 more for this one is definitely worth it.The comfort , the looks , the loudness , the RGB (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). I even got 129 cashback so it had to be a steal deal for me 😁.I'm so glad I bought this as my first headphones. I was very skeptical but now that I'm using it 😍 , Its just a wonderful experience.Most negative comments I believe are one in hundred Instances or anomaly or exceptions. Most people DON'T review a product till it's defective. Only very few people review when the product it perfect.This is to help first timers like me or for anyone who want a good headphone.Don't worry bout anything , just go for it. Luck can be bad sometimes nd you might get a bad piece , just get it replaced nd voila , problems solved. Its not like 100% of manufactured products are bad ☠️. Anyway.

And With the full sound ☠️ You won't hear even if someone's getting murderrred in the next room ☠️ Its that awesome.  Sound does leak , but its tooo loud as well. I mean , its like a freakin mini speaker on medium volume when you keep it aside and max the volume. It is crazyyyy . You can just hang it on your neck if it gets too hot n you'll still hear everything.It is honestly my very first Wireless headphones. But I have used Boat Rockerz which my friend has , And I can say without a doubt , Giving 200 more for this one is definitely worth it.The comfort , the looks , the loudness , the RGB (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). I even got 129 cashback so it had to be a steal deal for me 😁.I'm so glad I bought this as my first headphones. I was very skeptical but now that I'm using it 😍 , Its just a wonderful experience.Most negative comments I believe are one in hundred Instances or anomaly or exceptions. Most people DON'T review a product till it's defective. Only very few people review when the product it perfect.This is to help first timers like me or for anyone who want a good headphone.Don't worry bout anything , just go for it. Luck can be bad sometimes nd you might get a bad piece , just get it replaced nd voila , problems solved. Its not like 100% of manufactured products are bad ☠️. Anyway. Ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.Read more; The media could not be loaded.Before receiving the product, these were my concerns:-1. alot of reviews were bout how the mic is bad , hence I was concerned.2. Worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. Cuz I needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.3.Comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .4.Sturdiness and Build quality.5.Looks obviously , pictures were good but I didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.Quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.Now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. NOT A SINGLE CONCERN WAS FOUNDED TO BE TRUE.1.Mic is working absolutely fine. You can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. If you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. Now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). For all other purposes its perfect.2.I received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am I switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. It has been playing non stop. Its perfect. If you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. You don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). Battery life is sufficient. I haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. Anyway , by what I've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. Firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. Very comfortable. Its definitely over the ears and Completely covers them. Even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. Also , I dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , I've seen heavier gaming headphones. Don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .4.Build quality is very nice , Sturdy and strong. The speakers are tightly held with the band and while I don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. It loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . The RGB looks so beautiful and catchy. The overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . Is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. Everything is perfect. Though I wish now that I should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... It would've looked cooler with RGB.6. With Bluetooth , its justt Awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. Though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠Ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ I Like It (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). I don't play games so I can't talk bout Latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. Now talking bout the wired mode. It Might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. The clarity is just perfect and No latency ofcourse. No need of battery in aux mode.

Ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.; Great Budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together. Great build quality. Great fit can put straight for 2 to 3 hours, after it might feel a bit discomfort, depends on person to person. Great battery, brand claims 40hr and i get too around 38 to 39hr in it which says its approved for long hours. Very good sound quality, if you are confused between two headphones in this budget and you like BASS more, then pick this one it has great bass. So everything is good, but there is one major, very big problem which is kinda aceeptable for someone and not for a lot of pepole. The problem is Sound leakage, if you listen even above 50% vol or for some songs even at 30% vol, the sound starts to get outside earphone. your experience won't get bad for urself but the outsiders could also hear it which is why its not good to use it in public. if u go on 90% volume, rather than a headphone it becomes a speaker, u won't face any problem in ears, but voice outside will come loud easily hearable. It means brand gave everything, but could not block the speakers towards the outer end meaning voice gets outside easilyRead more; Great Budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together.

I got it for a nice deal (approx. Rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). I was reviewing multiple headphones under the Rs. 5k range. My first choice was the Sony CH-520, but I did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and I didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under Rs. 5k). The other options were Boat, Zebronics (a different set), Hammer and a variety of other ones.Among them I did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. I wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. It was available at a reasonable price and the RGB lights impressed me. So I ordered them.PROS:- Sounds good! I'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. No issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. The bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- Sturdy. The headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. While laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. I have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. They are still in good shape- RGB. The lights are definitely funky. They look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- Battery. Applaudable battery without hesitation. I use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.CONS:- Mic. I've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. My peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what I just said- Huge cushions and ear muffs! The size of the muffs are simply too big. When traveling with the headphones on in buses, I like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. But this is simply not possibly with these headphones. The muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. When I try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. So I'm forced to sit rigid for a while- Terrible button placement. The power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. This makes it very hard to use the controls. I have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. It's so ridiculous that I stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- Bad USB-C connection slot. The USB-C connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other USB-C wires because it has a narrow deep opening. So my phone's USB-C charger doesn't fit in it. Only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. This means I always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackOverall decent pair. In my previous (edited now) review, I mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. After several days I realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. So, I have edited my review and updated the ratingCheers!Read more; 3.5/5I have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. I got it for a nice deal (approx.

From the moment I received the product, it has been nothing but a headache. The headphones are completely defective – the Bluetooth feature does not work at all. I tried connecting them to multiple phones, including different brands and models, but the headphones simply refuse to pair. It’s clear that the product is faulty, and no amount of troubleshooting has made a difference.When I reached out to the seller for assistance, their response was utterly unhelpful. They provided no useful solutions or support, and it felt like they were just brushing me off. I then tried to initiate a return and refund through Amazon, only to find out that it’s not possible. How is this even acceptable? I paid for a product that doesn’t function as advertised, and now I’m stuck with it. It’s incredibly frustrating to feel like I’ve been scammed out of my money.To make matters worse, Amazon’s customer service was no help either. They were unable to resolve the issue and offered no real solution. It’s shocking that a platform as large as Amazon would allow such poor-quality products to be sold and then fail to support customers when things go wrong. The entire experience has left me feeling cheated and helpless.This purchase has been a total waste of time and money. The headphones are useless, the seller is unresponsive, and Amazon’s customer service is ineffective. I regret ever buying this product and will definitely think twice before making another purchase on Amazon. The lack of accountability from both the seller and Amazon is unacceptable.I would strongly advise others to avoid this seller and be cautious when shopping on Amazon. There’s no guarantee that you’ll receive a functional product, and if something goes wrong, you might be left with no recourse. Save yourself the frustration and shop elsewhere. This experience has been a complete disaster, and I will never recommend this seller or rely on Amazon for a resolution again.Read more; I am beyond disappointed with my recent purchase of wireless Bluetooth headphones from Amazon.

I have these earphones from 4 months and these haven't tangled since. Also the rubber coating and the inside braided wires gives a nice  looking effect.But 1 thing I have seen is the middle piece which have a mic and buttons is 180 degree reversed. so, many times it's difficult to pick the right or left earphone without seeing. But it is mentioned on the earphones so that becomes easy.Now about the main part the internalsThe sound quality is so so nice. 😊As you can see in my title. Solid 8/10. You can listen any music like lofi or peacefull type and when it's time for a party you can listen rock, bass boosted songs with such a adorable quality its the true definition for true sound and at cheap prices.Bass quality is also good.perfect for the ears. And if u want high bass, I tried it with max bass it can produce and that's awesome. But don't listen high bass for long. Those can hurt ur ears really bad.But noice cancellation is 4/10.seems like there is no noice cancellation. Maybe its mentioned for the mic not for the earpiece.Obviously there are very high quality products then this product but those will alteast cost 2000. But I will choose this product instead of a 1500 one or less than 1500 because this cost less than 500 or sometimes less than 400(depends on sale) but quality and services of these products are not less than of a 2000 rs earphone.In past, 1 of my earphone died but the coustmer care is so generous, there services are so cool and quick. So those got replaced within 3 days. (it's 3 days because I forgot the eslip, if you mail them with everting ready it won't take more than 2 working days)It's an honest review by me and I will definitely suggest you to but these. ☺️🙃Edited:-Their services are slower now. Don't know why and it takes around 1. 5week to 2 weeks to get the refund. If something happens to ur earphones.Also its been like 1 year as of 1-9-21And I saw some trend with it. My brother earphones stop producing sound from one side evey 4 months or soBut mine earphones be with me for 5 months.It's not a problem though cause you can mail 'em regarding this. This happened with me even with extra proper care of the earphone.Still the best earphones, you can find at this price pointRead more; So first, let's talk about the external-Bulid quality is awesome 9/10 even at such an affordable price.Looks-I have all 3 colours of these earphones and all colours looks coolWire-the wire quality is 9/10. I have these earphones from 4 months and these haven't tangled since. Also the rubber coating and the inside braided wires gives a nice  looking effect.But 1 thing I have seen is the middle piece which have a mic and buttons is 180 degree reversed. so, many times it's difficult to pick the right or left earphone without seeing. But it is mentioned on the earphones so that becomes easy.Now about the main part the internalsThe sound quality is so so nice. 😊As you can see in my title. Solid 8/10. You can listen any music like lofi or peacefull type and when it's time for a party you can listen rock, bass boosted songs with such a adorable quality its the true definition for true sound and at cheap prices.Bass quality is also good.perfect for the ears. And if u want high bass, I tried it with max bass it can produce and that's awesome. But don't listen high bass for long. Those can hurt ur ears really bad.But noice cancellation is 4/10.seems like there is no noice cancellation. Maybe its mentioned for the mic not for the earpiece.Obviously there are very high quality products then this product but those will alteast cost 2000. But I will choose this product instead of a 1500 one or less than 1500 because this cost less than 500 or sometimes less than 400(depends on sale) but quality and services of these products are not less than of a 2000 rs earphone.In past, 1 of my earphone died but the coustmer care is so generous, there services are so cool and quick. So those got replaced within 3 days. (it's 3 days because I forgot the eslip, if you mail them with everting ready it won't take more than 2 working days)It's an honest review by me and I will definitely suggest you to but these. ☺️🙃Edited:-Their services are slower now.

Not a day in my life is spent without the need to use them (for meetings, listening to music, and even to pick up calls when riding a bike). So when my previous headphones stopped working, I needed to buy new ones immediately. I was a little on budget with the shaadi season and secret santa going on. I came across this product while searching for wireless headphones and the pricing at 699 and the 3.9 rating caught my eye. I thought 3.9 is almost 4 and that's where I was mistaken. I believed the ratings and ordered it. I was caught up in a very close friend's wedding. So when the product came, I couldn't test/use it immediately.

So for this I gave it 2 stars for noise cancellation and 4 for volume control...I think they could've gone up a tiny bit more for the volume.  The sound quality itself, other than being too low which dropped it down a star, wasn't bad.  However, after 3 months, it's crackling.  So 3 stars for that.  My daughter is a little hard on headphones...we usually have to buy the $5 ones from Five Below because we know in 3-6 months we'll be replacing them.  I was hoping to find these to be more durable, but the cord where the AC Jack goes in is weak, which is what ended up causing the crackling issue.  If you get some sugru when you get these and immediately apply it to the AC Jack's cord area to prevent a lot of bending, you might avoid this issue, and then these would be good for a toddler (since they're so quiet) or preschooler.Read more; Like with most kids headphones, the sound is regulated but it's SO regulated my daughter could barely hear over general noise in the room.

I got the order today and the package is good without any damage. But the issue is with the earphones. The left earbud is producing static noise and the sound is low compared to right side. It's not like it started after a few days or months. It started on same day as I received the order and just a few minutes after I started using. I don't know if everyone is facing this issue (saw similar comments on YouTube and reviews) but this is causing very bad hearing experience. I assume it may be due to driver issue or wiring in left side. Request to please take note of this feedback for both buyers and the boat companyRead more; I purchased Boat Rockerz 255 Z Plus.

And volume is too loud 😍Bhaiyo kharid lo awesome product hai.Thankyou noise and Amazon for this best experience.😍; I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS. These headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.Let's start with the build quality. Imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. They weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. Yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.Now, I'm a reasonable person. Accidents happen. So, I contacted NOISE support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. What I got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. They dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).So, here I am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. The audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. My advice? Steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. Unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.For those seeking a more constructive alternative:Do your research! Read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.Prioritize build quality. Look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.Understand the warranty terms thoroughly. Don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.Remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. Choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.Read more; I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS.

Worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. Cuz I needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.3.Comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .4.Sturdiness and Build quality.5.Looks obviously , pictures were good but I didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.Quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.Now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. NOT A SINGLE CONCERN WAS FOUNDED TO BE TRUE.1.Mic is working absolutely fine. You can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. If you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. Now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). For all other purposes its perfect.2.I received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am I switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. It has been playing non stop. Its perfect. If you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. You don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). Battery life is sufficient. I haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. Anyway , by what I've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. Firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. Very comfortable. Its definitely over the ears and Completely covers them. Even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. Also , I dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , I've seen heavier gaming headphones. Don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .4.Build quality is very nice , Sturdy and strong. The speakers are tightly held with the band and while I don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. It loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . The RGB looks so beautiful and catchy. The overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . Is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. Everything is perfect. Though I wish now that I should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... It would've looked cooler with RGB.6. With Bluetooth , its justt Awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. Though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠Ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ I Like It (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). I don't play games so I can't talk bout Latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. Now talking bout the wired mode. It Might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. The clarity is just perfect and No latency ofcourse. No need of battery in aux mode. Can keep using it even if the battery is dead. I Like this feature so much. For a student like me , its a charmer. No unnecessary breaks . And With the full sound ☠️ You won't hear even if someone's getting murderrred in the next room ☠️ Its that awesome.  Sound does leak , but its tooo loud as well. I mean , its like a freakin mini speaker on medium volume when you keep it aside and max the volume. It is crazyyyy . You can just hang it on your neck if it gets too hot n you'll still hear everything.It is honestly my very first Wireless headphones. But I have used Boat Rockerz which my friend has , And I can say without a doubt , Giving 200 more for this one is definitely worth it.The comfort , the looks , the loudness , the RGB (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). I even got 129 cashback so it had to be a steal deal for me 😁.I'm so glad I bought this as my first headphones. I was very skeptical but now that I'm using it 😍 , Its just a wonderful experience.Most negative comments I believe are one in hundred Instances or anomaly or exceptions. Most people DON'T review a product till it's defective. Only very few people review when the product it perfect.This is to help first timers like me or for anyone who want a good headphone.Don't worry bout anything , just go for it. Luck can be bad sometimes nd you might get a bad piece , just get it replaced nd voila , problems solved. Its not like 100% of manufactured products are bad ☠️. Anyway. Ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.Read more; The media could not be loaded.Before receiving the product, these were my concerns:-1. alot of reviews were bout how the mic is bad , hence I was concerned.2. Worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. Cuz I needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.3.Comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .4.Sturdiness and Build quality.5.Looks obviously , pictures were good but I didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.Quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.Now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. NOT A SINGLE CONCERN WAS FOUNDED TO BE TRUE.1.Mic is working absolutely fine. You can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. If you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. Now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). For all other purposes its perfect.2.I received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am I switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. It has been playing non stop. Its perfect. If you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. You don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). Battery life is sufficient. I haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. Anyway , by what I've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. Firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. Very comfortable. Its definitely over the ears and Completely covers them. Even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. Also , I dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , I've seen heavier gaming headphones. Don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .4.Build quality is very nice , Sturdy and strong. The speakers are tightly held with the band and while I don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. It loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . The RGB looks so beautiful and catchy. The overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . Is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. Everything is perfect. Though I wish now that I should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... It would've looked cooler with RGB.6. With Bluetooth , its justt Awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. Though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠Ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ I Like It (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). I don't play games so I can't talk bout Latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. Now talking bout the wired mode. It Might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. The clarity is just perfect and No latency ofcourse. No need of battery in aux mode. Can keep using it even if the battery is dead. I Like this feature so much. For a student like me , its a charmer. No unnecessary breaks . And With the full sound ☠️ You won't hear even if someone's getting murderrred in the next room ☠️ Its that awesome.  Sound does leak , but its tooo loud as well. I mean , its like a freakin mini speaker on medium volume when you keep it aside and max the volume. It is crazyyyy . You can just hang it on your neck if it gets too hot n you'll still hear everything.It is honestly my very first Wireless headphones. But I have used Boat Rockerz which my friend has , And I can say without a doubt , Giving 200 more for this one is definitely worth it.The comfort , the looks , the loudness , the RGB (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). I even got 129 cashback so it had to be a steal deal for me 😁.I'm so glad I bought this as my first headphones. I was very skeptical but now that I'm using it 😍 , Its just a wonderful experience.Most negative comments I believe are one in hundred Instances or anomaly or exceptions.

Ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.; Great Budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together. Great build quality. Great fit can put straight for 2 to 3 hours, after it might feel a bit discomfort, depends on person to person. Great battery, brand claims 40hr and i get too around 38 to 39hr in it which says its approved for long hours. Very good sound quality, if you are confused between two headphones in this budget and you like BASS more, then pick this one it has great bass. So everything is good, but there is one major, very big problem which is kinda aceeptable for someone and not for a lot of pepole. The problem is Sound leakage, if you listen even above 50% vol or for some songs even at 30% vol, the sound starts to get outside earphone. your experience won't get bad for urself but the outsiders could also hear it which is why its not good to use it in public. if u go on 90% volume, rather than a headphone it becomes a speaker, u won't face any problem in ears, but voice outside will come loud easily hearable. It means brand gave everything, but could not block the speakers towards the outer end meaning voice gets outside easilyRead more; Great Budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together.

I got it for a nice deal (approx. Rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). I was reviewing multiple headphones under the Rs. 5k range. My first choice was the Sony CH-520, but I did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and I didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under Rs. 5k). The other options were Boat, Zebronics (a different set), Hammer and a variety of other ones.Among them I did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. I wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. It was available at a reasonable price and the RGB lights impressed me. So I ordered them.PROS:- Sounds good! I'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. No issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. The bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- Sturdy. The headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. While laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. I have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. They are still in good shape- RGB. The lights are definitely funky. They look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- Battery. Applaudable battery without hesitation. I use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.CONS:- Mic. I've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. My peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what I just said- Huge cushions and ear muffs! The size of the muffs are simply too big. When traveling with the headphones on in buses, I like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. But this is simply not possibly with these headphones. The muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. When I try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. So I'm forced to sit rigid for a while- Terrible button placement. The power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. This makes it very hard to use the controls. I have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. It's so ridiculous that I stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- Bad USB-C connection slot. The USB-C connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other USB-C wires because it has a narrow deep opening. So my phone's USB-C charger doesn't fit in it. Only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. This means I always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackOverall decent pair. In my previous (edited now) review, I mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. After several days I realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. So, I have edited my review and updated the ratingCheers!Read more; 3.5/5I have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. I got it for a nice deal (approx.

I had this in my last headphones (non-brand, cheaper!) and it's so convenient that you miss it and curse whoever is lacking behind in this basic feature.  But the good battery backup leaves you plenty time to recharge.* Too tight. Again, a basic feature IMO to make it feather light which again, a lot of cheaper non-brand headphones are offering, such a shame to see it lacking too. Ears will get hot even in winter/AC. But great if you're a runner, they won't come off.* Multipoint connection is better than others as it allows you to fully switch between two devices rather divide the audio between calling and music mode.

On wireless mode, I didn't find the sound quality to be as great as I expected it to be. The noice cancellation was also not exceptional. The main problem was that when I plugged in the audio cable, I found out that the right earcup of the headphone was not working at all. It was because of loose-connection (inside headphones) somewhere I guess. I decided to give it some time before I tested it once again. This time, the wireless mode sound quality dropped significantly (On sharp beats, it started producing cracking sounds). This time on wired mode, both the earcups worked fine and the sound quality was really good. After 2-3 days of usage, cracking sound is still there on wireless mode. Overall I am not satisfied with these headphones. I would recommend not investing such an amount in JBL headphones but rather to go for budget earphones. I don't think JBL puts their best efforts in this price range. If you really want high quality, go for a high-price flagship model.Read more; Just after unboxing, I tested the headphone.

These headphones deliver exceptional sound quality, with deep bass and crisp highs that truly enhance my listening experience, whether I’m enjoying music, podcasts, or movies.The comfort level is impressive, too. The ear cushions are soft and plush, making them perfect for long listening sessions without causing any discomfort. The adjustable headband ensures a secure fit, which is great for both casual use and more active settings.Battery life is another standout feature; I easily get several hours of use on a single charge, and the quick charging option is a lifesaver when I’m in a hurry. The wireless connectivity is seamless, with no noticeable lag or dropouts during use.Additionally, the build quality feels sturdy yet lightweight, making them portable for travel. The included carrying case is a nice touch for protection on the go.Overall, the JBL over-ear headphones are an excellent choice for anyone looking for high-quality sound and comfort.

Design:The neckband boasts a sporty design, making it ideal for activities like gym workouts, cycling, or jogging. It’s more suited for an active lifestyle rather than a formal or classy look.2. Connectivity:While it lacks the ability to connect to two devices simultaneously and only supports Bluetooth 5.0 (instead of newer versions), it still excels in quickly pairing with the connected device. This makes it reliable enough to count as a positive.3. Music Quality:Considering its budget-friendly price, the music quality is decent. It offers a satisfactory listening experience for casual use.4. Durability and Build Quality:Although I’ve only had it for a week, the build quality seems superior compared to the low-grade products commonly found in the same price range. While it doesn’t have a premium look, it feels sturdier than typical budget options. I'll provide an update on its long-term durability later.Cons1. Battery Life:The battery life falls short of the company's claims, lasting only 3–4 hours. This isn’t uncommon for budget-friendly neckbands, as lightweight, high-quality batteries are typically reserved for premium models. However, the false advertising by the company is disappointing.2. Button Placement:The volume and power buttons are placed too close to each other, making it difficult to differentiate between them. This may lead to accidental call disconnections while adjusting the volume. Although it’s not a major issue, it can be inconvenient.Read more; The neckband offers a mix of pros and cons that you should consider before purchasing.Pros1.

Nonetheless, giving 5 stars as it passes all other expects except gaming.; OK, so I have been using these for the past 3 days and I was using my AirPods pro before that for gaming and everything else so I will be comparing these headphones to that I know the price difference but you also need to understand that the JBL has bigger drivers and is over the ear so I think it's fair. So my initial question was do these sound as good as my Airpods? I started with the song I always listen to when I get a new pair of headphones, Hotel California by Eagles, and these headphones well they sounded too sharp almost pain full like those cheap 100 Rs earphones.So, I saw some reviews and there was a split some saying they are pretty good and others saying they are not good for music and so on. I ended up replacing my first pair of JBL. The point being if they sound like crap start by replacing them because no headphone should sound that sharp especially not with a branded pair they probably have a QC issue.  My second pair of these JBL's arrived the next, they sounded like the graph that is shown on the box pulled up high-end, mids, and bass basically increasing the overall volume of the headphone sounds bad right well not really.It's not for music I mean you can listen to it it's not bad but it's not very good either, it depends on what you listen to for example if you listen to Bollywood trash (no offense I listen to them from time to time) then these headphones are not it but if you listen to older songs from classic bands (pink Floyd, guns and roses, etc) or for that matter classic Indian Sangeet those extra high-end notes really make these headphone sing. Movies are amazing, remember the extra mids and bass from the graphs well they do an amazing job of recreating the voices and the atmosphere the extra highs can be a problem if the actor has a higher-pitched voice and gets irritating so pick your poison.Gaming, these are gaming headphones after all. I play games on my Xbox, I bought them for my Xbox and I have not a single bad thing to say about these even my first defective pair blew my head. Witcher 3 (Yes, I still play that game) the atmosphere the headphones create is truly amazing there were times I turned back to see if there was actually someone, it blows my AirPods away, you could hear the tree trunk crack leaves fly the wind it's truly something to experience. Next is Forza and my opinion stays the same, same with AC odyssey as well as PUPG. The mic is also very good too video calls or phone calls should not be an issue at all I mean if you are planning to buy rebranded Chinese crap from the likes of cosmic bite or Red dragon or gear then stop and buy this instead. But if you are planning to buy the more expensive Hyper x cloud series then buy that only this is not for you.Finally, let's talk about fit and finish as it will determine the isolation and comfort of any headphones. For me these headphones fit perfectly, they clamp down with just enough pressure so as to not hurt my head but are strong enough to prevent them from falling off. The fit almost reminds me of Bose QC 25 headphones. This means the isolation is pretty awesome they are no active noise canceling of course but is more inline with passive noise isolating earphone so basically all the earphone on the market. The drives are placed at some distance from your ear this does two things. One, your ears don't rest on the driver like in most of these cheap Chinese crap second it helps with spatial audio. The finish, on the other hand, well its cheap plastic and there is no two ways about it you touch the headphone you will know what I am talking about, It won't break but its no bose or apple in this regard, you get what you pay for the cable is braided and tangle-free though. The cushion is pretty good, it not the softest memory foam or the thickest but again it gets the job done it's covered with fake leather and is nonreplaceable so when they wear out you need to buy a brand new pair of headphones.Conclusion, buy them if you are on a budget I don't think there is a better pair at this price that has the audio quality this has in games. If you have no budget and want a headphone that does everything then my Airpods pro is the winners but I would recommend the hyper x cloud series for gaming if you have the budget for it at 7K.  Or if you want something to go along with your Xbox and don't want to spend too much like me then I would say buy these you will be happy.Read more; OK, so I have been using these for the past 3 days and I was using my AirPods pro before that for gaming and everything else so I will be comparing these headphones to that I know the price difference but you also need to understand that the JBL has bigger drivers and is over the ear so I think it's fair. So my initial question was do these sound as good as my Airpods? I started with the song I always listen to when I get a new pair of headphones, Hotel California by Eagles, and these headphones well they sounded too sharp almost pain full like those cheap 100 Rs earphones.So, I saw some reviews and there was a split some saying they are pretty good and others saying they are not good for music and so on. I ended up replacing my first pair of JBL. The point being if they sound like crap start by replacing them because no headphone should sound that sharp especially not with a branded pair they probably have a QC issue.  My second pair of these JBL's arrived the next, they sounded like the graph that is shown on the box pulled up high-end, mids, and bass basically increasing the overall volume of the headphone sounds bad right well not really.It's not for music I mean you can listen to it it's not bad but it's not very good either, it depends on what you listen to for example if you listen to Bollywood trash (no offense I listen to them from time to time) then these headphones are not it but if you listen to older songs from classic bands (pink Floyd, guns and roses, etc) or for that matter classic Indian Sangeet those extra high-end notes really make these headphone sing. Movies are amazing, remember the extra mids and bass from the graphs well they do an amazing job of recreating the voices and the atmosphere the extra highs can be a problem if the actor has a higher-pitched voice and gets irritating so pick your poison.Gaming, these are gaming headphones after all. I play games on my Xbox, I bought them for my Xbox and I have not a single bad thing to say about these even my first defective pair blew my head. Witcher 3 (Yes, I still play that game) the atmosphere the headphones create is truly amazing there were times I turned back to see if there was actually someone, it blows my AirPods away, you could hear the tree trunk crack leaves fly the wind it's truly something to experience. Next is Forza and my opinion stays the same, same with AC odyssey as well as PUPG. The mic is also very good too video calls or phone calls should not be an issue at all I mean if you are planning to buy rebranded Chinese crap from the likes of cosmic bite or Red dragon or gear then stop and buy this instead. But if you are planning to buy the more expensive Hyper x cloud series then buy that only this is not for you.Finally, let's talk about fit and finish as it will determine the isolation and comfort of any headphones. For me these headphones fit perfectly, they clamp down with just enough pressure so as to not hurt my head but are strong enough to prevent them from falling off. The fit almost reminds me of Bose QC 25 headphones. This means the isolation is pretty awesome they are no active noise canceling of course but is more inline with passive noise isolating earphone so basically all the earphone on the market. The drives are placed at some distance from your ear this does two things. One, your ears don't rest on the driver like in most of these cheap Chinese crap second it helps with spatial audio. The finish, on the other hand, well its cheap plastic and there is no two ways about it you touch the headphone you will know what I am talking about, It won't break but its no bose or apple in this regard, you get what you pay for the cable is braided and tangle-free though. The cushion is pretty good, it not the softest memory foam or the thickest but again it gets the job done it's covered with fake leather and is nonreplaceable so when they wear out you need to buy a brand new pair of headphones.Conclusion, buy them if you are on a budget I don't think there is a better pair at this price that has the audio quality this has in games.

Design:Overall design is good and you can wear them whole day if you can avoid that shark fin holders😅Button position is also good and easy to operate.2. Battery lifeWhile you are connected to phone either you are using the Neckband or not. It consumes some power continuously and last for 9-10 hours.3.

And this is not great because listing to full volume for a long time can damage your ears.4. ChargingIt does support the fast charging. You can enjoy your Neckband again after 1.5hours of full charging.5.cVc technologyThis technology is used for making clear voice calls while you are in a crowded area. It works pretty well but if the noices are too much it wouldn't help you either.6. Sound qualityMusic I'm getting over it good.

Highly recommended!; It is best at this budget, but ha the quality is bit bad , if u can handle it well ,then there is no other problem .Read more; It is best at this budget, but ha the quality is bit bad , if u can handle it well ,then there is no other problem .; The best headphones in this budget, I'm 6'3 and I have a big skull and ears but these fit perfectly on my head and are very comfortable! Secondly the battery life is amazing, on a single charge I use this for like 40-45 Hrs and it still doesn't stop! Sound quality is decent in these but it's not cheap at all, tho i would say the durability is below average in these, but it's totally fine for an average user. Most importantly the mic is trash, i bought one of these in 2021 which broke in 2024 so I bought it again in 2024 and in both of the models, the mics did not work and that's the only drawback of this Headphone.Read more; The best headphones in this budget, I'm 6'3 and I have a big skull and ears but these fit perfectly on my head and are very comfortable!

Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is almost fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). It is average in terms of gaming. If you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. You can buy this headphone for games like Minecraft. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.Thank you for reading. Just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.Read more; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition.

Although I am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. There is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. Which is a pity, but ah well. Can't have it all, can ya?Best bluetooth headphones at 799 for sound AND mic quality. And let's not forget comfort. Headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.Although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.Even though I have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  Even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. So if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these. But if you don't mind going for EARPHONES, then there are many better options available in terms of sound quality.Read more; Surprisingly exceeded my expectations.

They were a reluctant replacement for my existing pair back then which had broken down. I never believed that these would be anywhere near par with those but boy, was I wrong.I always go for wired earphones because of my own reasons. The main of which are the sound quality and the overall performance of the earphones across the entire spectrum of sound. To buy a pair with a similar performance as these in bluetooth earphones you could easily have to shell out as much as ten thousand bucks. The main antagonist of wired earphones which is entanglement of the wires never bothers me much so I usually don't have much of a problem.To compare it with the other earphones in the wired category of the same range, these are hands down miles ahead of any competitor. They may be a hundred odd bucks expensive from its competitors but the overall value derived from these far outweighs that amount. The manufacturers now a days very shrewdly give features in their earphones which allow them to play bass very well which gives an impression that they are indeed fabulous on an ordinary hearing. But if you continue to test them on different parameters of sound performance you soon realize that its a deliberate marketing ploy deployed by the manufacturers to fool you into believing that their earphones are far superior than their price tag. These kinds of earphones usually fall flat on every other parameter. Their performance at high volumes become undesirable and sound phony to the ear. The noise is shrill at higher notes and the sound never is tempered across the entire frequency range except maybe when the bass kicks in. However, you won't find any such jarring problems in these earphones. Sony has been in the music business for long and they know how to provide quality to their customers and know that their customers demand quality from them. They don't disappoint with this product. I may be wrong but I can go out on a limb and say that these are probably the best earphones you may find till the fifteen hundred price range. The other, mainly Chinese, competitors are out to hoodwink their customers into buying their products by tempting price tags and superficially apparent features but you can easily give them a pass in favour of this pair.TL,DR - These might be the best earphones in this price range and even amongst ones in a level higher range. Don't fret and buy this product assuredly.Read more; I've had these earphones for two years now and I couldn't be more happy with them.

I’ve been using the Blaupunkt BH41 for about two months now, and they’ve proven to be a solid choice for casual listening. At this price point, they offer a balanced mix of sound quality, build, and features, though they’re not without a few compromises. Here’s a quick breakdown of my experience.---Pros:✅ Nice Sound Quality:The BH41 delivers a pleasant sound signature with decent bass, clear mids, and crisp treble. It works well across most music genres and is also good for podcasts and videos. While it doesn’t cater to audiophiles, for casual use, it’s more than enough.✅ Solid Build Quality:The build feels sturdy and durable, giving the headphones a premium touch. I’ve used them daily, and they’ve held up well without any noticeable wear or creaking.✅ Lightweight & Comfortable Fit:These headphones are super lightweight, making them comfortable for long listening sessions. The clamping force is just right, and I didn’t experience any fatigue, even after hours of use.✅ Aux Port for Wired Mode:One of the best features is the inclusion of an aux port, allowing you to switch to a wired connection when the battery is low. It’s a lifesaver during long trips.✅ Impressive Battery Life:Battery life is surprisingly good. I’ve consistently gotten around 25-30 hours of playback on a single charge, making them perfect for extended use without worrying about recharging.---Cons:❗ Bluetooth Version & Latency:The BH41 uses an older Bluetooth version, which results in a slight delay when watching videos or gaming. It’s not a dealbreaker, but noticeable latency can be annoying if you’re sensitive to sync issues.❗ Small Ear Cups – Almost On-Ear Feel:Although marketed as over-ear headphones, the ear cups are quite small. If you have larger ears, they may feel more like on-ears. Luckily, my ears are on the smaller side, so I got a snug fit, but this might not be the case for everyone.❗ No Aux Cable Included:While the aux port is a great addition, it’s disappointing that no aux cable is included in the box. If you want to use them wired, you’ll need to buy a separate cable.❗ No App Support (But Not a Major Issue):There’s no companion app for EQ adjustments or firmware updates. While this isn’t a big issue considering the price, having app support would’ve been a nice bonus.---Verdict:After two months of use, I can confidently say that the Blaupunkt BH41 is a reliable budget option that ticks most of the right boxes. The sound quality is enjoyable, the build is solid, and the battery life is impressive. However, the slightly outdated Bluetooth, smaller ear cups, and lack of an included aux cable may be minor annoyances for some users.If you’re looking for a pair of budget-friendly headphones with decent sound and versatility, the BH41 is worth considering. While it’s not perfect, it offers enough value to make it a solid choice for everyday use.Read more; I’ve been using the Blaupunkt BH41 for about two months now, and they’ve proven to be a solid choice for casual listening.

Luckily, my ears are on the smaller side, so I got a snug fit, but this might not be the case for everyone.❗ No Aux Cable Included:While the aux port is a great addition, it’s disappointing that no aux cable is included in the box. If you want to use them wired, you’ll need to buy a separate cable.❗ No App Support (But Not a Major Issue):There’s no companion app for EQ adjustments or firmware updates. While this isn’t a big issue considering the price, having app support would’ve been a nice bonus.---Verdict:After two months of use, I can confidently say that the Blaupunkt BH41 is a reliable budget option that ticks most of the right boxes. The sound quality is enjoyable, the build is solid, and the battery life is impressive. However, the slightly outdated Bluetooth, smaller ear cups, and lack of an included aux cable may be minor annoyances for some users.If you’re looking for a pair of budget-friendly headphones with decent sound and versatility, the BH41 is worth considering. While it’s not perfect, it offers enough value to make it a solid choice for everyday use.; I recently purchased the **Blaupunkt BH41** headphones, and they exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is outstanding—deep bass with crystal-clear audio.🔹 **Comfort:** The ear cups are soft and lightweight, making them comfortable for long hours.🔹 **Battery Life:** Lasts for hours on a single charge.🔹 **Connectivity:** Fast and stable Bluetooth connection with no lag.🔹 **Build Quality:** Premium design with sturdy materials.Overall, this is one of the best headphones in this price range. Blaupunkt has done a great job. Highly recommended!Read more; I recently purchased the **Blaupunkt BH41** headphones, and they exceeded my expectations.

Blaupunkt has done a great job. Highly recommended!; This is a overall very good product it's sound quality is very good and clear. Vocals are very clear ,trebels are good everything is excellent But some points should be cleared before buying.The bass is not loud compared to dedicated bass headphones you the bass but also feel that it is not loud so much you. If you use Equalizer the bass enhance, so I recommend to use Equalizer.Distortion occurs in some songs in full volume , the  you have to low the volumeSound leakage is also happens when the surrounding environment is calm and you listen music in full volume people around you may observe the sound.The kushons are very comfortable I can easily wear it for hours and it don't create pain in ear. It also fits my whole ear,my ear is medium size.Dual pairing is not written anywhere but it works I connected it to laptop and mobile also when sound shifts from one device to other device it takes 3 seconds delay.Enc is also quite good when the surrounding environment is normal but I didn't test it in heavily noisy area.Also I don't test the battery life as I use only aux cable.Mic is also very good.I didn't test it for gaming as I am not a gamer.RecommendationIf you are a heavy bass lover don't buy it otherwise you can buy it. distortion only occurs sometimes in full sound in some songs only.

"OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 ANC Bluetooth in Ear Earphones with Mic, 45dB Hybrid ANC, Bombastic Bass - 12.4 mm Drivers, 10 Mins Charge - 20 Hrs Music, 28 Hrs Battery (Booming Black)","₹2,099",4.1,B0CBTTCJL6,https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-ANC-Bluetooth-Earphones-Bombastic/dp/B0CBTTCJL6/ref=sr_1_86?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.QGCtGLc6wP2LKyNwNPfDpKQknDYdBD6zkVoqYhyYNPnOiNB_0NNd0YeL0VfuGf6WgnNE4dxgAM-dJz66zbHG1I6h9ePPNpSuT3JkrWu_A61gKijyYJr6iGtcZkOif7zrxR0D3QomhRVCfe02t2dCDlpLwONIPv839ItklhRt9h98VLLXOeS8jZfOBMPgzWayzauA4GpPWCmI78wpaRFbVf9CiW4UeMVGXa5jRQdS_7g.Yw2ZBP7YDJY3PMfO1TpX-zJ2t4DosjoX9LUmZ4NQTXc&dib_tag=se&keywords=headphones&qid=1747130911&sr=8-86,"If you're on the lookout for a solid pair of wireless earphones, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 might just catch your eye. I've been using them for a while, and here's my honest take on what they have to offer.Connectivity & Ease of Use:Let’s start with one of the essentials—connectivity. The OnePlus Bullets Z2 nails it with seamless Bluetooth connectivity that just works. Pairing them with my phone was as simple as it gets, and once connected, they stay that way without any annoying drops. The button placement on the neckband is intuitive, and after a day or two of use, I could easily control playback without needing to glance down, thanks to muscle memory. It’s the kind of convenience you don’t realize you need until you have it.Sound Quality - Balanced Yet Personal:Now, onto the sound quality. As someone who values a balanced sound signature, I found the Z2 to be a great match for my taste. Whether I'm listening to some mellow jazz, electronic beats, or even rock, the sound remains well-rounded and crisp. The highs, mids, and lows don't overpower each other, making it perfect for those who don't want their ears blasted with bass or overwhelmed by treble.That said, sound quality is a subjective experience, and preferences can vary widely. If you're a bass head looking for those earth-shaking lows, you might find these a tad restrained. But if, like me, you appreciate a balanced output across genres, these will hit the right notes for you.Battery Life & Quick Charging - A Week of Peace:Battery life is another highlight. With moderate use—think about 1-2 hours daily—you can stretch a single charge to last an entire week. Even if you’re a heavy listener, using them for 6-8 hours straight, they can hold up for around 2-3 days before needing a recharge. And the quick charge feature is a lifesaver—just 10 minutes of charging gets you 2-4 hours of extra playtime, which is perfect for those “oops, I forgot to charge them” moments.Gaming & Low Latency - Smooth Experience:I spend a fair bit of time playing games like BGMI, and the low latency mode on the Bullets Z2 makes a noticeable difference. There's minimal lag between the visuals and the audio, which makes for a much more immersive gaming experience. It's not just about the sound being clear; it's also about it being on time, and these earphones deliver that pretty well.Comfort & Passive Noise Isolation:Comfort is key when it comes to neckbands, and the Z2 doesn’t disappoint. They come with multiple earbud sizes, so you can pick the one that fits snugly for you. While there’s no active noise cancellation (ANC) here, you can achieve a decent level of passive noise isolation by choosing the right ear tips. This makes a noticeable difference in cutting out background noise during commutes or at the office.App Experience & Annoying Blinking Light:Now, onto a couple of quirks. The Bullets Z2 uses the HeyMelody app, which offers additional features like custom sound settings. However, my unit just wouldn’t connect with the app, which was a bummer. So, any fancy tweaks you could make through the app were out of my reach, and I had to rely solely on the default Bluetooth pairing. While everything worked smoothly once connected, I feel like I missed out on some customization options that might have enhanced my experience.Another thing that bugged me was the small white light that blinks when the neckband is connected to a device. It might not seem like a big deal, but if you’re using the earphones in a dark room or while lying down, that blinking light can be pretty distracting. Plus, it probably drains the battery a bit, albeit a small amount. A simple option to turn this off in the app would’ve been a nice touch.Final Thoughts - A Solid Pick for Most, with Room for Improvement:Overall, the OnePlus Z2 delivers where it matters—good sound quality, reliable connectivity, and battery life that won’t have you constantly reaching for the charger. It’s not perfect, especially with the blinking light and app connectivity issues, but those are minor compared to the solid performance it offers. Plus, with the quick-charge feature and low-latency gaming experience, it’s hard not to appreciate the value you get.If you’re looking for a reliable neckband that blends style, comfort, and balanced audio, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 is definitely worth considering.

They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.The earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating.Pairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.You get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.As for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.If you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.That said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.They come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.The Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity.

The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass.; Excellent Battery Life: One of the standout features is the impressive battery life, often cited around 20-30 hours on a single charge.Fast Charging: A quick 10-minute charge can provide a significant amount of playtime (around 10-20 hours), which is very convenient.Good Bass Response: The 12.4mm drivers deliver a punchy and powerful bass, making them suitable for bass-heavy music genres.Comfortable Fit: The lightweight design and comfortable ear tips allow for extended listening sessions.Secure Fit: The magnetic earbuds can be snapped together when not in use, preventing tangles and accidental loss, and also pausing/resuming playback on some devices.Water and Sweat Resistance: With an IP55 rating, they are suitable for workouts and light rain.Affordable Price: They generally offer good value for their price range.Decent Call Quality: The microphone provides acceptable call quality for everyday use.Quick Pairing: They often feature quick and easy pairing with OnePlus devices.In conclusion, the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are a solid pair of wireless neckband earbuds, particularly for those who enjoy a strong bass response and prioritize long battery life and fast charging at an affordable price.Read more; Excellent Battery Life: One of the standout features is the impressive battery life, often cited around 20-30 hours on a single charge.Fast Charging: A quick 10-minute charge can provide a significant amount of playtime (around 10-20 hours), which is very convenient.Good Bass Response: The 12.4mm drivers deliver a punchy and powerful bass, making them suitable for bass-heavy music genres.Comfortable Fit: The lightweight design and comfortable ear tips allow for extended listening sessions.Secure Fit: The magnetic earbuds can be snapped together when not in use, preventing tangles and accidental loss, and also pausing/resuming playback on some devices.Water and Sweat Resistance: With an IP55 rating, they are suitable for workouts and light rain.Affordable Price: They generally offer good value for their price range.Decent Call Quality: The microphone provides acceptable call quality for everyday use.Quick Pairing: They often feature quick and easy pairing with OnePlus devices.In conclusion, the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are a solid pair of wireless neckband earbuds, particularly for those who enjoy a strong bass response and prioritize long battery life and fast charging at an affordable price.; Good quality, little bigger the end of the neck band because of a bigger battery.

The fit is good and the design is nice in my opinion, very slim and light weight. Despite the magnetic connection of the earbuds being the only way to power down the device this has not been an issue, they snap together and power down flawlessly. They are comfortable and the connection is the fastest I've ever seen and they connect to my S24 within a few seconds after separating the magnetic backs of the earbuds. Sound quality is decent, but the price and functionality has surpassed expectations as I've been using them for over 5 months and I've only had to charge them maybe once every other week for like 30 minutes.Read more; Bought these for the 2-3 hours a week I am at the gym and the battery life is good.

But then i read reviews for this and compared it over rtings.com and finally ended up getting these.I was not expecting much from the noise cancellation or the bass I only needed a comfortable headphones for my work day to focus.Oh boy was I surprised. The ANC is perfect for me. It wont drown out everything and sharp bursts of noise will come through, but anyway so complete silence is not what I need. At 50% volume (at which these sound amazing btw), it downs out the background droning noises to like 1% and I cant even tell my coworkers are speaking even if they are just 6 feet away from me (I can still here some mumbles but I wont be able to understand the words so I don't get distracted anymore).Coming to the sound, these are my first headphones so I can only compare it to my speakers. And I am comparing apples to oranges here but in comparison to that, these are not that great, but then again those cost like 4x as much and have much more hardware so this is a stupid comparison on my end anyway.So for these I only wanted two things - clarity and bass. These speakers have excellent quality when it comes to clarity and with the eq set to bass mode well these speakers do deliver some bass but it wont blow your mind away. But then I remember how cheap these are and I'd say they are 5/5 value for money.And these fold up too unlike the Sony ones so storage is much easier.I could not find any cons yet after my 1 wee use. Might edit this review if I find any.I would just recommend you wipe down the ear pads (which are extremely comfortable btw) once a week or so, otherwise they might get damaged coz again these are pretty cheap and they would have to do cost cutting somewhere.Read more; The media could not be loaded.This is my first ever JBL product (and my first ever over the head headphones).First of all, I love Japanese products and was initially leaning towards the Sony WH-CH720N.

It looks pretty good with impressive fit and finish. The buttons feel well built yet the headphone is quite light. It did not hurt my ears even after long hours of continuous use.Sound Quality: I am an audio visual production professional and I felt it sounds quite balanced (for a JBL) in the Eq off setting. Pump up the volume and it can get pretty loud. The 'super bass' eq mode really pumps up the bass. The bass response is deep with precise attacks and releases, does not sound boomy at all. I like how these headphones sound. The calling quality too is surprisingly good. It cuts most ambient noises coming into the microphone while on a phone call.ANC: Does the job Okay but there are much better ANC headphones available in the market. Compared to the Bose Quiet series, the apple airpods pro or even the Sony headphones with ANC these felt inferior. In my recent travel in an airplane, these headphones started crackling; especially while the airplane was taking off. The filtration of the aircraft engine sound kept varying throughout my three hours of flying.Ergonomics: It takes a little while to get used to the position of the buttons. I felt that the ANC on-off toggle button should have been placed on the other earpiece of the headphone and not along with the power button or the volume control/play-pause buttons. Again, takes a while to get used to this button position. The charging port is on the top side of the right earpiece. Thus, you cannot use the headphones while charging them. The wired connection option is definitely a handy option if you want to use them connected to a computer on a table. The wire is a TRRS jack and kept playing in mono when connected to a TRS only socket.Battery Backup: Very good battery backup so even with a continuous use with ANC for approx 6 hours and with about 60% volume on music and multiple phone calls, it just consumed 40% charge.Overall verdict: It's a good buy only if you have budget constraints and you're offered hefty discounts. If not then there are far better ANC headphones available in the market.Read more; I have been using various ANC headphones for years and I bought these because my Airpods Pro got spoilt and I forgot my Bose Quiet Control 30s at home while travelling.

So if you are a music lover and loves a lot of bass, it is not for you. You can amp up your bass from the device you have paired it to, but it doesn't hit anywhere close to premium bass quality. On the other hand if you watch a lot of Content which involves dialogues and documentaries, this is the perfect headphone for you as it gives amazing speech clarity. i would say this is also an Editors and Gamers Headphone, where communication is very important and speeches takes great importance over beats and rhythms. I like that we can Swap between Ambient aware and Noise cancellation, and it's greatest pro is the Battery life. This headphone as a very good battery life, you can run it for days without even realizing that you need to charge it. i use it for work, meetings and calls, and also for editing purpose, and i am happy with my purchase, but if i was a sound editor or into Audio Compositing i think there are better options in the market at the same price.Read more; This Headphone is a bag of mixed feelings, but let me break down what is good about it and what is missing.On one hand i feel there is a lack of Bass when i am listening to pop and upbeat music, but at the same time i works well when i am watching documentaries or doing editing as it enhances the audio by boosting its treble.

What’s worse is that there’s no repair option available—almost as if the company expects you to just buy a new pair for ₹7,000.

And volume is too loud 😍Bhaiyo kharid lo awesome product hai.Thankyou noise and Amazon for this best experience.😍; I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS. These headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.Let's start with the build quality. Imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. They weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. Yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.Now, I'm a reasonable person. Accidents happen. So, I contacted NOISE support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. What I got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. They dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).So, here I am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. The audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. My advice? Steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. Unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.For those seeking a more constructive alternative:Do your research! Read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.Prioritize build quality. Look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.Understand the warranty terms thoroughly. Don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.Remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. Choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.Read more; I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS.

During calls, the mic doesn't perform as well, which can be frustrating if you plan to use these headphones frequently for communication.Build Quality:Additionally, the build quality may seem a bit fragile.

The build quality for the headphones is pretty good for the price, comfortable to wear, however they face some issues with volume. The headphone isn't loud enough, sound quality is also bad, my earphones have better sound quality and loudness compared to these headphones, didn't notice any directional audio when playing any game. The headphones come with various connectors, the USB is just for the LED, it has a two pin connector for mic and audio and comes with an adapter for single jack output, I tried both and directly connecting two pin to PC makes the audio quality even worse so I would suggest using the adapter. Overall I would suggest you keep looking for better headphones, these ones get the job done but if you care for audio quality them these won't satisfy you.Edit: After 4 months of use, one side of the headphones stopped working, don't buy these, these are cheap common headphones to which the company only puts its brand stickers and sells, these are not manufactured buy Ant, you can search on Amazon and find these exact headphones being sold by other brands as well.Read more; Review for H530.

After couple of weeks of sending reminders and not getting response, raised another complaint. Item was couriered at my cost (Rs 300) and awaiting for resolution.

I love the RGB lights on the headphone which looks awesome. Now for the sound and mic, in my opinion this is the best headphone ever in this price range which includes mic+audio to single jack for mobile which none other headphones include and sound quality is awesome. Normal audio and also game sounds are clear, when we listen to music it gives clear point sound each and every instrument sound will be clear. I havent used other headphones so in my opinion this is best headphone. It is very comfortable to wear but when we use for long time there will be heat on ears. Mic quality is awesome and controls also good. If you have realtek audio driver in your pc make sure to check the clear noices and other things and also keep mic audio boost so that your voice will be clear. Nice thick cardboard box packing from amazon. No damages to the box and product.Edit: Be careful with the headphone wire connected to headphone left ear and don't pull or bend it because the headphone didn't work until I bend the wire after 45 days and so had to be sent for warranty. The acro engineering company OH MY GOD! IT TOOK 30 DAYS MORE FOR PRODUCT REPLACEMENT UNDER WARRANTY. But its working good now and please be careful with headphone wire joints of any headphone.Read more; I brought Ant Esports H350 Gaming Headset for online studying, gaming and also music.

Lightweight and comfortable, with good noise cancellation and clear sound quality. Battery life is excellent, lasting up to 35 hours with ANC on. Multipoint pairing is a plus for switching devices easily.Here’s a review for the Sony WH-CH720N headphonesSony has a strong reputation for delivering high-quality audio products, and the WH-CH720N is a mid-range noise-canceling headphone that aims to balance affordability, comfort, and performance.Design & ComfortOne of the standout features of the CH720N is its lightweight build. At just 192 grams, it’s among the lightest ANC headphones in its category, making it comfortable for long listening sessions. The earcups are well-padded, though the plastic build might not feel as premium as Sony’s higher-end models like the WH-1000XM5.Sound QualitySony has equipped these headphones with 30mm drivers, and while they don’t deliver the deep bass of the XM series, they provide clear mids and crisp highs, making them ideal for vocals and balanced soundtracks. The DSEE (Digital Sound Enhancement Engine) helps restore some lost details in compressed music, improving overall audio clarity.Noise Cancellation & Ambient ModeThe Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is powered by Sony’s V1 processor, the same one used in the WH-1000XM5, though the effectiveness is slightly toned down. It effectively reduces low-frequency noises like airplane hums and air conditioners but struggles with high-pitched sounds. The Ambient Sound Mode is a great addition, allowing users to stay aware of their surroundings when needed.Battery Life & ConnectivitySony claims a 35-hour battery life with ANC on, which is impressive. Even with heavy use, you can go several days without charging. A quick 3-minute charge provides 1 hour of playback, which is great for those on the go. Connectivity is seamless with Bluetooth 5.2 and multipoint pairing, allowing you to switch between devices effortlessly.Call Quality & Extra FeaturesThe beamforming microphones and AI noise reduction improve call clarity, making it a decent choice for work calls. Sony’s Headphones Connect app offers sound customization, including an EQ adjustment and 360 Reality Audio support.Pros & Cons✔️ Lightweight and comfortable for long usage✔️ Good ANC for the price✔️ Balanced sound quality with DSEE upscaling✔️ Excellent battery life✔️ Multipoint Bluetooth pairing❌ Plastic build feels less premium❌ ANC isn't as strong as higher-end modelsThe Sony WH-CH720N is an excellent mid-range ANC headphone for those who want Sony’s signature sound and noise cancellation without breaking the bank. While it lacks the premium feel and top-tier ANC of the XM series, its lightweight design, solid audio quality, and long battery life make it a great option for daily usInitially, I received a damaged outer box, but the seller promptly replaced it, ensuring a smooth experience.

Appreciate their quick response!Overall, a solid choice for daily use at this price point.; I am using it continuously for last 6 months and gave it 5🌟 overall for the things it offers in the price of just 6k... Yes 6k is just the initiation of good quality ANC bluetooth over the ear headset, people are expecting XM or bose or Sennheiser quality in 6k or 8k,lol....if it's in 8k or 10k range i would give it 4🌟 instead. Here's my findings —Pros:-1. Sound output - 4.5/5 ... Default sound is pretty flat, but quickly gets interesting after playing with eq, dsee, anc etc. . Sound volume is pretty average but distortion in max vol. is low. It's a general purpose headset, good enough for all aspects like rock, pop, bass,instrumental, classical, rap etc. . Seperation is nice, different tones have distinct identities. But for specific needs like for bass or vocal, strech your budget a bit more. I don't think you can get better than this balance of sound output in this budget.2. ANC - 4/5 actually it's pretty decent, but could be a little better. Afterall it's an entry level ANC.3. Built - 4.5/5 simplistic plastic built, no fancy cosmetics, but solid and mature, very much flexible, not gonna break anytime, good elasticity for sticking with head. Though it's plastic built but has stainless steel housing around stretchable arms which is very nice to have for long term usage. Most headsets break from this sections.4. Battery- 5/5 fabulous battery life even with anc on . Charging it like smartphones from 20 to 90% and getting about 1 week to 10 days of battery life with intense usage. Charging takes about 50 mins for the above session.5. Comfort - 4/5 nice padded ear cups, but brings sweat quickly and then feels a bit warm... But prolonged usage doesn't hurt that much as once i had used it about 2hrs at a single strech.6. Connectivity- 5/5 very strong bluetooth connectivity, works seamlessly even with 10 meters of distance with walls and different floors.But still not that useful for online gaming via wireless mode as it has a little bit of latency.Cons. :-1. Crap when connected to PC via wire and headset turned off.2. Like other over the ear, gets uncomfortable in scorching summer and humid conditions.3. Lack of ldac , hence no hi-res audio, but in this price bracket it's ok.4. Though doesn't feel cheap, but some aesthetics should be there.Verdict:- You can absolutely go with it if you are getting it around 6000/- for no specific taste. Don't expect it to outperform those ult or XMs, it's illogical to think. If you want the ultimate one then there are XM, momentum, quitecomfort or those beyerdynamics....instead of going with intermediates, either go with this one or go with those super expensive ones. And those people comparing it with much lower priced headphones and saying it worse, they simply don't have the sensitivity to differentiate between subtle frequencies, and those subtle frequencies make it sweet.'Made for iPhone/iPod' written on the outside of the box, which is strange, probably will work better with ios than android.

Ele é leve, emparelha com todos os meus dispositivos e carrega rapidamente.  A redução de ruídos é muito boa também. Contudo, fiquei um pouco frustrada mesmo por ele não vir com o estojo para viagem, que é vendido de forma avulsa e custa quase R$200,00. Se eu tivesse me atentado a esse detalhe, teria pagado um pouco mais em um modelo mais avançado. Outro ponto que para mim é negativo é que ele pesa um pouquino e sinto os maxilares travarem no início, mas depois de algum tempo me adapto e não sinto mais incômodo.Enfim, é uma boa opção de fone, mas se estiver disposto a pagar um pouco a mais é melhor comprar um modelo mais recente.Read more; Estou satisfeita com o fone.

Overall it is a good buy for my outdoor runs.; UPDATE 31MARCH2025: (This post will help people as I see many reporting issues with connectivity/distortion/quality. )The issue as I see is with Samsung Android devices and not with other phones like nothing 2a as a family member has that and this headphone works fine there. Nevertheless, if you experience distortion or quality issues, you can try changing the bluetooth codec as mentioned below.Samsung has its own codec too which it uses for its earbuds.UPDATE 30MARCH2025: (This post will help people as I see many reporting issues with connectivity/distortion/quality. )Mostly as I saw the reviews - issues reported were with distorted sound/quality of sound and with a set of devices and mostly people saying that it was seen with windows pc. I was able to fix the problem myself. PLEASE NOTE: There was no help from Noise. Noise tech did not help troubleshoot.).My ticket was just closed from Noise end and so I realised if I went back there again,  the device would just  go back and forth only but my problem would not get fixed. No one from Noise called me through the entire process to even understand the issue in detail or even when it was marked checked after sending it back for the first time.----TECHNICAL EXPLANATION---How I solved the issue - A common problem reported from multiple reviews was about distortion(sometimes written as quality) and was with some devices and then mostly with windows pc users. So, it cannot be that such a priced headphone will have substandard quality when some verified purchases reviews having 5 stars. The battery is good. So, some issue might be with the chipset hardware.""Codec"" is coding-decoding and a bluetooth codec is used to compress and decompress audio data for efficient wireless transmission. Depending upon the codec the quality of your sound differs.This device seems to be defaulting to AAC (advcd audio encoding) which apple devices use. I had to go to ""Developer Options"" in android (to enable ""Developer Options"" in Android please google it) and try another codec. I switched to SBC (Sub-Band Codec) on my phone which is a very old codec and is prone to losses, and then it sounded fine. Attached two images for reference.for Samsung:1 Go to ""Settings""2 Tap ""About device"" or ""About phone""3 Tap “Software information”4 Tap “Build number” seven times. ...5 Enter your pattern, PIN or password to enable the Developer options menu.6 The ""Developer options"" menu will now appear in your Settings menu.PLEASE NOTE: YOUR PHONE NEEDS TO BE CONNECTED/PAIRED WITH THE HEADSET FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE BLUETOOTH CODEC OPTION IN YOUR ""DEVELOPER OPTIONS"" IN ANDROID. IF YOU ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE HEADSET, THE OPTION FOR CODEC SELECTION WILL BE GRAYED OUT.But upon shutting down and turning back on after few hours, when it pairs again, the setting goes back to AAC at times. Its a pain changing it again when you disconnect and reconnect back.On PC its completely distorted. Windows does not allow to change codecs. Based on what I found, it does not have selections like we have for Android. I will keep looking for a way to change it.Whichever manufacturer the chipset is being imported from, is having different codecs than samsung android.UPDATE 29MARCH2025:I received the headphones back from noise and they just sent back the same thing in broken state.I cannot imagine why a company is doing this. It's like ""here its back again but just in a diff box""Now again open a ticket and then send back item. Why did i purchase this from amazon in the first place. I should have gone to a shop purchased it. Atleast would not be facing this.Complete utter disregard to customer. Its customer problem. Let him be with a broken thing.========================Never seen such worse quality by paying this much money. Sound distorted right out from the box. Listen to audio -spotify or anything, even phone call, sound is heavily distorted. Any other of my old bluetooth headphones and earphones are fine. Breaks heavily in between. I do not know how even people gave it 5 stars. But if you hear a music, its as if like the audio tape is getting stuck in between.Not worth the money. Defective in sound right from the box. Never seen such bad quality that too for a higher priced item.And to top it, Amazon's stand is this has to be taken up with noise only. That too I just received it today.I opened up a ticket with noise.

The ability to connect to multiple devices simultaneously and switch between them effortlessly adds to the convenience.; The boAt Rockerz 650 Pro is a solid offering for anyone looking for a feature-packed, stylish, and budget-friendly pair of wireless headphones. I’ve been using the Iris Black variant for a few days now, and here’s my honest take:🔊 Sound Quality (4.5/5):With Dolby Audio support, the sound is immersive, crisp, and detailed. Whether you're watching movies, listening to music, or gaming, the audio depth is impressive for this price point. Bass lovers will also enjoy the punchy lows without compromising mids and highs.✨ Touch/Swipe Controls (4/5):The touch/swipe gestures on the earcups are responsive and intuitive. It might take a little time to get used to, but once you do, it feels smooth and futuristic. No more fumbling for buttons!🔋 Battery Life (5/5):Absolutely insane! Up to 80 hours of playback is no joke. Even with moderate-heavy usage, you’ll easily get a week or more on a single charge. Plus, the ASAP fast charging gives several hours of playback with just 10 minutes of charging — super handy for last-minute top-ups.🎤 Call Quality (4.5/5):The dual mics with ENx tech offer great noise cancellation during calls. Even in noisy environments, the voice clarity remains top-notch. Great for meetings or long voice chats.📱 App Support & Dual Pairing (4/5):The boAt app adds a nice layer of customization — you can tweak the EQ settings, check battery levels, and even get firmware updates. Dual Pairing is also a neat feature, especially if you’re switching between a laptop and phone.🛠️ Build & Comfort (4/5):The build feels sturdy, and the cushioning on the earcups is plush and comfortable for long listening sessions. The design looks sleek in Iris Black — modern yet minimal.Read more; The boAt Rockerz 650 Pro is a solid offering for anyone looking for a feature-packed, stylish, and budget-friendly pair of wireless headphones.

I got the product in full chage after using it for 2 days almost 8-10 hours instagram,spotify and calling it dropped to 90%.It still have 70% and its been 4 days over a 20-25 hours of usage. Earpads are comfortable ears will get sweaty after an over or so but can't complain as its an over the ear. It could have been so great if it had ANC but again i don't think any good over the ear headphones comes with ANC in this price range. And to note I didn't felt any improvement in the sound with the dolby customization however it is there might be good while watching movies i guess. Haven't tried it yet. Don't know about the charging time since I have enough to last couple of days more. Size is ok suits best. Build quality is a 7/10. The earcup material is thin am afraid it may not last for a long time other than that its good. Accidental touches are there so you have to be careful with that one.Read more; Good one!!

Depending on the device can be seriously loud. Now I learned never to connect whilst wearing them.; Battery Backup is really not good. I run marathons, and it takes around 5hours to complete, but these earphones gets discharged in just 3hours.Another downpoint is, it is very difficult to charge after few weeks of purchase, the charging pins in case dont detect earphones easily and I have to keep setting it properly in the case to make earphones charge, although the pins are magnetic, but it dont fit properly itself.Next downpoint is, charging case dont get connected with my type c mobile charging cable, instead the they only get charge with the given type c cable, because of case design having curves and, depth of charging socket.There is no cover on case charging socket, due to which it gets sweat inside while keeping in clothes during running, which makes it vulnerable to sweat damage.During running, due to sweat getting over my earphones on ear, music gets on/off multiple times, and I have to start them again n again manually.The buttons in earphones dont work many times. I have click it multiple times to make them detect my touch fingers. Earphones quality is definately cheap like low quality chinese earphones(didnt expected such quality having used Boat Rockerz 510 before which were really good in battery life and quality terms).The only reason I bought these was portability while running which is not possible with my Boat rockerz 510.After few months of usage, the earpiece has become quite loose in wearing, which makes me afraid if it will get broken due to in/out multiple times.While I was making purchase, the product appeared to be small in size, but when I saw it, case is really big, earphones are really big. Which makes it difficult to carry everywhere, put in my bag, compared to other TWS I have used before like Samsung Buds Live.Case quality is very cheap, gets scratches very easily, battery backup of Charging Case is like 1.5 times charge for earpieces, that too sometimes it charges only 1 earpiece, not both completely. Its stops charging without any indication that charging is complete or something.Unfortunately Boat Brand is now involved into selling cheap and low quality product practices, which makes me think to shift to other brands for good quality, rather than thinking about made in india low quality products. Thought Boat products would last a lifetime, but they cant even last few months now. I have also used Mivi TWS open earphones before, and these Boat earphones made me feel the same way. Those Mivi earphones were worst I have used in my life. And it also had similar issues like unable to fit in case itself properly, unable to charge earpieces itself at first, charging pins issues, charging case socket issues.Read more; Battery Backup is really not good.

First, the audio quality- uniquely detailed. Every instrument, voice, chorus and Synth effect can be clearly and individually discerned. It is nicely bass-oriented, which adds great depth to an already elaborate soundstage. Even then, if you want to reduce bass, use the Dolby Atmos Equalizer on your Android phone to tailor the sound exactly to your taste. Hence, the absence of app-controlled Equalizer is not missed at all. Clamping force is noticeable in the first few days but reduces thereafter. ANC is very good for day to day use with a slight chop-off at the base end, but that is anyway not noticeable in a noisy environment. The transparent mode is a BIG PLUS and you will use it much more than you expect. The light weight and great padding really helps, since long hours are guaranteed with this pair on. Buttons are sturdy and a bit hard to press, but the layout is intuitive and easy to adapt to. Sound quality over Bluetooth is actually better than that over the cable, which is mildly surprising. Battery life is very decent. You'll certainly need to buy a hardened carrying case, though, of you don't want to damage the equipment while travelling.

Even then, if you want to reduce bass, use the Dolby Atmos Equalizer on your Android phone to tailor the sound exactly to your taste. Hence, the absence of app-controlled Equalizer is not missed at all. Clamping force is noticeable in the first few days but reduces thereafter. ANC is very good for day to day use with a slight chop-off at the base end, but that is anyway not noticeable in a noisy environment. The transparent mode is a BIG PLUS and you will use it much more than you expect. The light weight and great padding really helps, since long hours are guaranteed with this pair on. Buttons are sturdy and a bit hard to press, but the layout is intuitive and easy to adapt to. Sound quality over Bluetooth is actually better than that over the cable, which is mildly surprising. Battery life is very decent. You'll certainly need to buy a hardened carrying case, though, of you don't want to damage the equipment while travelling.

This is unacceptable for a product that claims to be premium.I strongly recommend avoiding this product. It’s overpriced, poorly made, and doesn’t live up to its claims.

Bass is punchy and strong and goes deep. Buttons are easy to use and very intuitive and these have over 22 hours of battery with ANC which is cool to see at this price point. Comes with Tile embedded which will be very useful if you lose your headphones. Build quality is very decent with soft touch plastic and metal headband. I think these will last a long time. Would highly recommend this product.Read more; Good ANC HeadphonesANC is very good for a 11K headphone comparable to the premium ones. Bass is punchy and strong and goes deep.

Will write more in depth review later.Sound quality:Pretty decent. As a person who likes neutral sound signature, hearing this amount of bass is pleasant. It will rattle your head with ANC TURNED OFF. With ANC TURNED ON, bass is lil less but it didn't bottom out. More like natural sounding one.  People with sensitive ear SHOULD GIVE THIS A CHANCE. Ambient mode is amazing and really useful when you want to be aware of your surroundings.Packaging:You don't get old cushiony pouch recently. Just a cloth bag with strings with Skullcandy logo on it.You will get 2 inch charging cable C-type cable. We all have long C type cable for phones. So, this will not be an issue for the people already have the cables.Packaging is indeed different from the release years. Skullcandy is always changing the packaging. Currently it looks similar to hesh evos.What I disliked so far is that the extention slider in the headband is loose right out of the box. It slides easily. No tension at all. I don't know whether SKULLCANDY intentionally made it that way or defective one. I've used headphones before. They usually slide off this much only after the use of a few good months.Read more; I've been using the product for past five days. Will write more in depth review later.Sound quality:Pretty decent.

Great battery life for the flights and recharged on the USB in the plane seat. The noise cancelling works great - way better than the earbuds. The over the ear fit was much more comfortable than smaller versions we tried, so could be worn for extended periods without any issue.The case that comes with is perfect for a backpack - they fold up compactly and then drop in the bag, no worries.The audio quality is great - as good or better than much more expensive headphones. Adjustments to the sound balance came through perfectly, which doesn't happen on most we have tried. Frankly, the sound was better on these than sets that cost several hundred dollars.The Skullcandy app is a great addition so you can see battery life and other features, but you can also just use the headphone alerts to know when to recharge. Recharging is quick, and a few minutes plugged in will give another hour of listening if you need to keep using them before you have time for a full recharge.Read more; Bought these for our son to use on a three week band trip through Europe - now I want a set, too.

The ANC is perfect for me. It wont drown out everything and sharp bursts of noise will come through, but anyway so complete silence is not what I need. At 50% volume (at which these sound amazing btw), it downs out the background droning noises to like 1% and I cant even tell my coworkers are speaking even if they are just 6 feet away from me (I can still here some mumbles but I wont be able to understand the words so I don't get distracted anymore).Coming to the sound, these are my first headphones so I can only compare it to my speakers. And I am comparing apples to oranges here but in comparison to that, these are not that great, but then again those cost like 4x as much and have much more hardware so this is a stupid comparison on my end anyway.So for these I only wanted two things - clarity and bass. These speakers have excellent quality when it comes to clarity and with the eq set to bass mode well these speakers do deliver some bass but it wont blow your mind away. But then I remember how cheap these are and I'd say they are 5/5 value for money.And these fold up too unlike the Sony ones so storage is much easier.I could not find any cons yet after my 1 wee use. Might edit this review if I find any.I would just recommend you wipe down the ear pads (which are extremely comfortable btw) once a week or so, otherwise they might get damaged coz again these are pretty cheap and they would have to do cost cutting somewhere.Read more; The media could not be loaded.This is my first ever JBL product (and my first ever over the head headphones).First of all, I love Japanese products and was initially leaning towards the Sony WH-CH720N.

It looks pretty good with impressive fit and finish. The buttons feel well built yet the headphone is quite light. It did not hurt my ears even after long hours of continuous use.Sound Quality: I am an audio visual production professional and I felt it sounds quite balanced (for a JBL) in the Eq off setting. Pump up the volume and it can get pretty loud. The 'super bass' eq mode really pumps up the bass. The bass response is deep with precise attacks and releases, does not sound boomy at all. I like how these headphones sound. The calling quality too is surprisingly good. It cuts most ambient noises coming into the microphone while on a phone call.ANC: Does the job Okay but there are much better ANC headphones available in the market. Compared to the Bose Quiet series, the apple airpods pro or even the Sony headphones with ANC these felt inferior. In my recent travel in an airplane, these headphones started crackling; especially while the airplane was taking off. The filtration of the aircraft engine sound kept varying throughout my three hours of flying.Ergonomics: It takes a little while to get used to the position of the buttons. I felt that the ANC on-off toggle button should have been placed on the other earpiece of the headphone and not along with the power button or the volume control/play-pause buttons. Again, takes a while to get used to this button position. The charging port is on the top side of the right earpiece. Thus, you cannot use the headphones while charging them. The wired connection option is definitely a handy option if you want to use them connected to a computer on a table. The wire is a TRRS jack and kept playing in mono when connected to a TRS only socket.Battery Backup: Very good battery backup so even with a continuous use with ANC for approx 6 hours and with about 60% volume on music and multiple phone calls, it just consumed 40% charge.Overall verdict: It's a good buy only if you have budget constraints and you're offered hefty discounts. If not then there are far better ANC headphones available in the market.Read more; I have been using various ANC headphones for years and I bought these because my Airpods Pro got spoilt and I forgot my Bose Quiet Control 30s at home while travelling.

So if you are a music lover and loves a lot of bass, it is not for you. You can amp up your bass from the device you have paired it to, but it doesn't hit anywhere close to premium bass quality. On the other hand if you watch a lot of Content which involves dialogues and documentaries, this is the perfect headphone for you as it gives amazing speech clarity. i would say this is also an Editors and Gamers Headphone, where communication is very important and speeches takes great importance over beats and rhythms. I like that we can Swap between Ambient aware and Noise cancellation, and it's greatest pro is the Battery life. This headphone as a very good battery life, you can run it for days without even realizing that you need to charge it. i use it for work, meetings and calls, and also for editing purpose, and i am happy with my purchase, but if i was a sound editor or into Audio Compositing i think there are better options in the market at the same price.Read more; This Headphone is a bag of mixed feelings, but let me break down what is good about it and what is missing.On one hand i feel there is a lack of Bass when i am listening to pop and upbeat music, but at the same time i works well when i am watching documentaries or doing editing as it enhances the audio by boosting its treble.

I received it on 21 October and today is 29 October and the battery is still at 50%. I know it's crazyyyyyzzyy. I regret why I didn't bought it sooner. Doesn't have heavenly sound like 50k headphones but it's has Nuclear generated Battery. which you will need to charge only 4to5 times a month.Bike rideIt's not ideal for bike riding, it's for indoor use, alot of wind noise when riding, but no wind noise when plugged inside the helmet, additionally it makes alot of noise when you touch the earphone wire, the noise is not from the speaker btwbatteryBattery is great, no question about it. It's been 8 day's, I use it everyday and carry it everywhere and still it has 50% battery. after 8 days continuous used.Sound loudnessThe sound is loud I Don't recommend anyone to use it more than 80% level unless you want to lose your hearing within a year. 40% sound level satisfy me.

I got the order today and the package is good without any damage. But the issue is with the earphones. The left earbud is producing static noise and the sound is low compared to right side. It's not like it started after a few days or months. It started on same day as I received the order and just a few minutes after I started using. I don't know if everyone is facing this issue (saw similar comments on YouTube and reviews) but this is causing very bad hearing experience. I assume it may be due to driver issue or wiring in left side. Request to please take note of this feedback for both buyers and the boat companyRead more; I purchased Boat Rockerz 255 Z Plus.

The sound quality is well-balanced, offering clear vocals, decent bass, and a good level of detail for casual listening.

Noise partnering with Bose for sound tuning really shows in the final product. I honestly didn't expect this level of sound quality from an Indian brand in this price range, but the audio clarity and balance are top-notch. The bass feels deep without overpowering, mids are clean, and the highs are crisp. Whether you're listening to music or watching a movie, the sound feels immersive and natural.The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is another highlight — it can cut out a surprising amount of background noise. Noise claims up to 49dB of noise cancellation, and while I haven't measured it, the performance feels on par with some higher-end earbuds. Even in crowded environments, the buds block out most distractions, making them perfect for travel or work.The design is sleek and minimal, with a comfortable fit that doesn't cause ear fatigue even after hours of use. The touch controls are responsive, and I love how you can customize them through the Noise Audio App.Battery life is impressive too — I got close to the claimed 44 hours with the case, and the buds last around 8 hours on a single charge. The dual device pairing feature is super convenient, letting me switch between my laptop and phone without any hassle.Overall, the Noise Master Buds feel like a big step forward for Indian audio brands. With Bose's tuning and solid features like ANC, spatial audio, and LDHC support, they easily compete with more expensive options.Read more; The Noise Master Buds genuinely surprised me — and in the best way possible.

The retro-inspired design is stylish and the earbuds fit comfortably, though they are slightly bulky. Sound quality is solid with 12.4mm titanium drivers delivering balanced audio across highs and mids, though treble can get a bit sharp at higher volumes. The Active Noise Cancellation (up to 49dB) works impressively well, especially in office and commuting environments. Battery life is another strong point, offering up to 50 hours with the case and a quick charge feature that’s super handy. Indoor call quality is great, but outdoor performance struggles with background noise. However, the build quality feels a bit plasticky and the case is on the larger side, which doesn’t quite match the premium price tag. Considering all this, I find the product slightly overpriced for what it offers, but still a solid choice for everyday use. I’m giving it 4 out of 5 stars.Read more; I recently purchased the Noise Master Buds from Amazon and overall, I'm quite satisfied with the experience.

From the sound quality to the battery life, these headphones offer a great experience. The 40mm driver delivers rich and detailed sound, making music, movies, and calls clear and immersive. The bass is deep, the vocals are crisp, and there’s a good balance between different sound frequencies. Whether I’m listening to soft melodies or high-energy beats, the sound quality is excellent. One of the best things about these headphones is the 70-hour battery life. I don’t have to worry about charging them daily, which is a big plus. Even after long hours of listening, they still have plenty of battery. The low latency mode (up to 45ms) makes a noticeable difference while gaming or watching videos. There is no delay between the sound and the visuals, making the experience smooth and enjoyable. This feature is especially useful for gamers who need real-time audio feedback. With dual pairing, I can connect the headphones to two devices at the same time, which is super convenient. I can easily switch between my phone and laptop without having to disconnect and reconnect. The Bluetooth v5.3 ensures a stable and fast connection with no interruptions.The Carbon Black finish looks stylish and premium. The ear cushions are soft and comfortable, making them easy to wear for long hours without discomfort. They are also lightweight, which is great for travel or extended use.I’m really happy with my purchase of the Noise 3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones. They provide excellent sound, long battery life, and smooth connectivity at a reasonable price. If you’re looking for a reliable and stylish pair of wireless headphones, this is a great choice.Would definitely recommend! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐; I recently got the Noise 3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones, and overall, I’m impressed. The sound quality is fantastic with rich bass and clear highs, thanks to the 40mm drivers. The low latency of up to 45ms is great for gaming or watching videos, ensuring no audio delay. With Bluetooth 5.3, the connection is stable and reliable, and the dual pairing feature is super convenient, allowing me to connect to two devices at once. The 70-hour playtime is incredible, meaning I don’t have to worry about charging often. However, the only downside is the comfort of the ear cushions. While they provide decent padding, they aren’t as comfortable as I had hoped, especially for long listening sessions. They could be softer and more cushioned to offer a better overall experience. Despite this, the sound quality and features make these headphones a great value for the price.Read more; I recently got the Noise 3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones, and overall, I’m impressed.

The finish is solid and stylish.Comfort: Major issue – the ear cups start hurting within 20-30 minutes. They’re tight and feel sharp around the ears, not suitable for long use.Sound Quality: Just average. Bass is weak, vocals are flat, and overall sound is not immersive. Definitely not for music lovers or gamers.Battery Backup: Good battery life, but what’s the use if you can’t wear it comfortably?Latency: Claimed 45ms low latency – works fine for casual YouTube videos, but not ideal for fast-paced gaming.Verdict:Great looks, poor comfort, and average sound.

Amazing battery backup I only need to charge it once per week and I listen to music atleast 2 hrs everyday. The sound quality is great but you may need to use equilizers to adjust the bass since this one is specially designed for high bass. My OnePlus already provides different mode of audio settings depends on the use so no trouble for me. Durability is amazing. I dropped it 2 times from 5 ft and nothing happened not even a scratch but if you sit on it , it will break for sure. It's not water proof by the way, it can resist small drops of liquids whether sweat or water but I won't recommend these for gym . And it's on ear not over ear headphones. Prolonged use can hurt back of your ears.Read more; Bought this 3 months ago, am totally impressed.

I’ve been using the Iris Black variant for a few days now, and here’s my honest take:🔊 Sound Quality (4.5/5):With Dolby Audio support, the sound is immersive, crisp, and detailed. Whether you're watching movies, listening to music, or gaming, the audio depth is impressive for this price point. Bass lovers will also enjoy the punchy lows without compromising mids and highs.✨ Touch/Swipe Controls (4/5):The touch/swipe gestures on the earcups are responsive and intuitive. It might take a little time to get used to, but once you do, it feels smooth and futuristic. No more fumbling for buttons!🔋 Battery Life (5/5):Absolutely insane! Up to 80 hours of playback is no joke. Even with moderate-heavy usage, you’ll easily get a week or more on a single charge. Plus, the ASAP fast charging gives several hours of playback with just 10 minutes of charging — super handy for last-minute top-ups.🎤 Call Quality (4.5/5):The dual mics with ENx tech offer great noise cancellation during calls. Even in noisy environments, the voice clarity remains top-notch. Great for meetings or long voice chats.📱 App Support & Dual Pairing (4/5):The boAt app adds a nice layer of customization — you can tweak the EQ settings, check battery levels, and even get firmware updates. Dual Pairing is also a neat feature, especially if you’re switching between a laptop and phone.🛠️ Build & Comfort (4/5):The build feels sturdy, and the cushioning on the earcups is plush and comfortable for long listening sessions.

It'll Fit On Big Size Ears Too. But You'll Have To Rest Your Ears After Every 30mins. Otherwise It'll Starting Little Bit Pain On Big Size Ears (Not Too Much Pain). But It's Perfect For Medium Size Ears Size. 👍🏻3) ANC Is Not There. If They Launch This Product With 49/50dB ANC Under 3.5k. People Will Also Buy It At This Price. But They Didn't Provide ANC That's The Major Con For It.4) Sound Leakage Is There. If You're Listening At 60-70% Then Other Person Will Also Hear Clearly What You're Listening.5) No Auto Off Feature Like They Provide In Boat Nirvana ION ANC & ANC Pro And Some Of Their Boat TWS. (For Ex.- If You're Not Listening After 15mins TWS Gets Power Off Automatically)My Opinion-It's An Lovely Headphone. If you'll Manage With Your Big Ears (That I Mentioned In Cons) & Compromise With ANC. Then You Are Good To Go..

"OnePlus Bullets Z2 Bluetooth Wireless in Ear Earphones with Mic, Bombastic Bass - 12.4 Mm Drivers, 10 Mins Charge - 20 Hrs Music, 30 Hrs Battery Life (Jazz Green)","₹1,399",4.1,B0C4FLDT56,https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Bluetooth-Wireless-Earphones-Bombastic/dp/B0C4FLDT56/ref=sr_1_136?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.oxBGfjX_3YSbXQCpjBsVWydsKpwxZd8Suazzph22ktGwXQuAIOb0w69r6IDZ4DTzmjqarbLeGVc5fa3sLVRr1Cj9kGVen6gIF_aHPCSVkqUsWiKhuXOlZ9EJY3jIGYgP0QjqOdraFEQYEFot8NIH0T-QbSwlt3wsjv3L1cqw1Tv2ZRQKr2sXWWWvCMOvlGfqHEZRsXHerbyWl-Pj0ROjb8QCYM8Y8itGMYEWy6VqDMI.koimZAacxeCDfeJZ3MXloBc52fRR7Ot3qdf9okQf8Qc&dib_tag=se&keywords=headphones&qid=1747130922&sr=8-136,"If you're on the lookout for a solid pair of wireless earphones, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 might just catch your eye. I've been using them for a while, and here's my honest take on what they have to offer.Connectivity & Ease of Use:Let’s start with one of the essentials—connectivity. The OnePlus Bullets Z2 nails it with seamless Bluetooth connectivity that just works. Pairing them with my phone was as simple as it gets, and once connected, they stay that way without any annoying drops. The button placement on the neckband is intuitive, and after a day or two of use, I could easily control playback without needing to glance down, thanks to muscle memory. It’s the kind of convenience you don’t realize you need until you have it.Sound Quality - Balanced Yet Personal:Now, onto the sound quality. As someone who values a balanced sound signature, I found the Z2 to be a great match for my taste. Whether I'm listening to some mellow jazz, electronic beats, or even rock, the sound remains well-rounded and crisp. The highs, mids, and lows don't overpower each other, making it perfect for those who don't want their ears blasted with bass or overwhelmed by treble.That said, sound quality is a subjective experience, and preferences can vary widely. If you're a bass head looking for those earth-shaking lows, you might find these a tad restrained. But if, like me, you appreciate a balanced output across genres, these will hit the right notes for you.Battery Life & Quick Charging - A Week of Peace:Battery life is another highlight. With moderate use—think about 1-2 hours daily—you can stretch a single charge to last an entire week. Even if you’re a heavy listener, using them for 6-8 hours straight, they can hold up for around 2-3 days before needing a recharge. And the quick charge feature is a lifesaver—just 10 minutes of charging gets you 2-4 hours of extra playtime, which is perfect for those “oops, I forgot to charge them” moments.Gaming & Low Latency - Smooth Experience:I spend a fair bit of time playing games like BGMI, and the low latency mode on the Bullets Z2 makes a noticeable difference. There's minimal lag between the visuals and the audio, which makes for a much more immersive gaming experience. It's not just about the sound being clear; it's also about it being on time, and these earphones deliver that pretty well.Comfort & Passive Noise Isolation:Comfort is key when it comes to neckbands, and the Z2 doesn’t disappoint. They come with multiple earbud sizes, so you can pick the one that fits snugly for you. While there’s no active noise cancellation (ANC) here, you can achieve a decent level of passive noise isolation by choosing the right ear tips. This makes a noticeable difference in cutting out background noise during commutes or at the office.App Experience & Annoying Blinking Light:Now, onto a couple of quirks. The Bullets Z2 uses the HeyMelody app, which offers additional features like custom sound settings. However, my unit just wouldn’t connect with the app, which was a bummer. So, any fancy tweaks you could make through the app were out of my reach, and I had to rely solely on the default Bluetooth pairing. While everything worked smoothly once connected, I feel like I missed out on some customization options that might have enhanced my experience.Another thing that bugged me was the small white light that blinks when the neckband is connected to a device. It might not seem like a big deal, but if you’re using the earphones in a dark room or while lying down, that blinking light can be pretty distracting. Plus, it probably drains the battery a bit, albeit a small amount. A simple option to turn this off in the app would’ve been a nice touch.Final Thoughts - A Solid Pick for Most, with Room for Improvement:Overall, the OnePlus Z2 delivers where it matters—good sound quality, reliable connectivity, and battery life that won’t have you constantly reaching for the charger. It’s not perfect, especially with the blinking light and app connectivity issues, but those are minor compared to the solid performance it offers. Plus, with the quick-charge feature and low-latency gaming experience, it’s hard not to appreciate the value you get.If you’re looking for a reliable neckband that blends style, comfort, and balanced audio, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 is definitely worth considering. It might not satisfy those who crave earth-shattering bass, but for most listeners, it's a worthy contender at its price point.Read more; If you're on the lookout for a solid pair of wireless earphones, the OnePlus Bullets Z2 might just catch your eye.

It might not satisfy those who crave earth-shattering bass, but for most listeners, it's a worthy contender at its price point.; There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking. They are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. The middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, U shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. The wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. One of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the USB Type C port on the side. You get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. The battery unit has the OnePlus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.The earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. When the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. The Bullets Wireless Z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. The material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. It also comes with an IP55 rating.Pairing the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. All you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. You can then look up the buds in the list of Bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. Once connected, the Bullets Z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.You get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. Now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, OnePlus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. Apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), OnePlus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. You have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. It may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of OnePlus earphones- 12.4mm. The fact that OnePlus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. The earbuds support two audio codecs, SBC and AAC.As for the audio performance, the Bullets Wireless Z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. While this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.If you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the Bullets Wireless Z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.That said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. We could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. As the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.They come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. But because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.The Bullets Wireless Z2 also face some heat from the likes of Oppo Enco M32 and the Realme Buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. The OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z2 are actually a great proposition for the price; you only need to have a liking for bass.Read more; There is nothing wrong with the looks of the Bullets Z2, they are actually quite decent looking.

The fit is good and the design is nice in my opinion, very slim and light weight.

Sound quality is decent, but the price and functionality has surpassed expectations as I've been using them for over 5 months and I've only had to charge them maybe once every other week for like 30 minutes.Read more; Bought these for the 2-3 hours a week I am at the gym and the battery life is good.

These headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.Let's start with the build quality. Imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. They weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. Yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.Now, I'm a reasonable person. Accidents happen. So, I contacted NOISE support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. What I got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. They dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).So, here I am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. The audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. My advice? Steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. Unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.For those seeking a more constructive alternative:Do your research! Read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.Prioritize build quality. Look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.Understand the warranty terms thoroughly. Don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.Remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. Choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.Read more; I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS.

Got these an attractive price in Feb 2025.1. Sound: The quality of sound / clarity is impressive, balanced and clear across bass, mid and treble. The bass is a passive bass (rich in tone but no physical vibration as I understand it means). The default bass is a bit rich for me so I toned it down using the EQ in the Bose App. Other than that, the rest is crystal clear to my ears.2. Active Noise Cancellation: Not seen better ANC in this price range. QC Ultras take it up a couple of notches with intelligent ANC adjusting to ambience. You can customise as per needs using modes. The “ANC level” control is no more accessible as a button, but instead is now set in “modes”. You can add any number of custom modes and mark some modes as favourites and the favourites can be toggled through using the multifunction button, when in use.If you want to simply tune out of the world with nothing playing on the device/ headphones, that works too. Silence.3. Designed for comfort and fit: Lightweight with a cushioned headband and ear pads hinged to an articulated aluminium frame, QC Ultras are designed well for long listening sessions avoiding ear fatigue.4. Battery Life: Upto a day on music, with a quick charge feature when needed.5. Connectivity: The Bluetooth 5.3 is enabled, and it can toggle between two devices at the press of a button (say, phone and laptop).6. Functionality has changed from previous generations with the volume control enabled through a capacitive-touch rib at the back of the right ear pad.7.Spatial audio is an addition. The spatial audio effect is easily observable. But, some fixing is needed to make the sound as good as when using without spatial audio. Maybe a firmware/software update coming soon?Bose QC Ultra headphones are superior for ANC, comfortable wearing, and sound clarity.Read more; QC Ultras are being quoted as Bose’s best ANC headphones to date.

The headphones are also lightweight, which makes them easy to carry around in my bag without feeling like a burden. The folding design is a nice touch for compact storage.Battery Life: The battery life is stellar. I’ve been able to use these for multiple days without having to charge them, and when I do charge them, the fast-charging feature is super convenient.Features: The touch controls are intuitive, and the app integration makes adjusting settings a breeze. I also love the customizable noise-cancelling modes, which allow me to tailor the listening experience to my environment.Overall: The Bose QC Ultra has quickly become my go-to headphones for travel, work, and leisure.

Previously, I owned the Sony WH-1000XM3, which was excellent.This model is undoubtedly an upgrade in terms of sound quality, fit, and noise cancellation. However, I did encounter one unusual issue—Bluetooth remained connected for hours even after removing the headphone, instead of disconnecting and entering sleep mode as expected. It happened only once, so it’s hard to say whether it was a firmware glitch or just a rare occurrence. Unfortunately, this did result in some battery drain.I purchased the Bose 60th Anniversary variant for around ₹25,000, which was certainly a great deal.Read more; After using the Bose QuietComfort Ultra for a month while traveling by flight and bus, as well as at home, I’m sharing my review.

La réduction du bruit est juste étonnant, bien au-dessus des AirPods Max, même dans des environnement bruyant assez difficile (vent). Niveau confort, c’est un sans-faute : il est super léger, ne fait pas mal à la tête, même après des heures d’écoute, et s’adapte parfaitement au personne qui porte des lunettes (ce qui n’est pas le cas de tous les casques).Côté son, il y a pas mal de basses a la sortie de boîte mais avec l’égaliseur de l’application (très simple à utiliser), on peut régler ça comme on veut. Résultat : un son riche avec et agréable pour tous les styles de musique, par contre j’ai pas ressenti une grosse différence avec l’Aptx adaptatives et sans et le côté immersion plus artificiel que autre chose. La housse rigide fournie est super pratique, bien meilleure que celles des QC45 ou AirPods Max qui est une blague.Je l’ai aussi testé pour le gaming : nickel en solo, mais à éviter pour les jeux multi à cause d’un petit décalage. Au final, ce casque est une réussite, polyvalent et bien pensé.

Visually they "" appear ""  to be a little bulky as compared to most of the earphones .  However they are not heavy and are quite comfortable to wear for extended periods . It will just take a few days to get used to the appearance .  With proper sound equalization the earphones sound very good .Bass is more than adequate but not very heavy . Heavy bass lovers might complain .The high frequencies ( treble ) are a little over emphasized  by design and at times , the treble actually sounds like screeching and is very uncomfortable. Again this can be overcome with proper equalization . But it's impossible to take it out completely unless you reduce the treble to bare minimum.But for all the issues the earphones are still very good .I still have to evaluate the performance of the inline mic.Those of you who want earphones with really  "" powerful bass ""  and  top notch sound quality without burning a hole in your pocket should go for the Blaupunkt EM-10  earphones . They are really powerful and pack a punch and they are priced below 600.00 .Have a little time to spare ? Please read on :This is a little lengthy observation so please bear with me and please read till the end. I am making these observations with the hope they will help users of earphones extract the best performance out of the earphones they buy. So let's begin .(1) Most of the earphones you purchase claim excellent performance and powerful bass. The claims may very well be true. But many people end up saying they are crap and sound like earphones you can buy by the roadside, which may not necessarily be true .You must remember that simply plugging in your brand new earphones into your smartphone ( or any audio device for that matter), will not automatically deliver beautiful sound. It is necessary to have good audio output and proper sound equalisation .Some smartphones have good audio engine (software) and equaliser built in , for example iPhones . Redmi also has these features built in. But many other smartphones don't. So if your device doesn't have these features make sure you install a good audio player with equaliser.Play your favourite songs and use the equaliser to properly adjust the sound. Remember that just one equalizer setting will not work for all the songs. This is the reason why all audio player software provide built in presets . Use the presets .(2) Allow some burn-in time for your earphones. The moving parts in earphones ( essentially the diaphragm ) usually will be a little stiff when they come out of the factory . Playing the earphones for a few hours warms up the earphones and makes the diaphragm a little supple and allows the diaphragm move freely improving the quality of the sound . So if your earphones don't sound good initially , they will after a few hours . Trust me.(3) For all the earphones, including the most expensive ones , over time you will find the output from one or both of the ear pieces drop significantly . This is natural and usually not a fault of the earphones . The main culprit is ear wax. Over time a fine layer of earwax gets deposited onto the fine protective mesh of the earpiece. This wax attracts dust and begins to block the air and prevents the diaphragm from vibrating freely (mechanical load) causing the output to drop. Simply increasing the volume to overcome the loss of output will only electrically overload and likely destroy your earphones .So regularly clean up the earpieces .I hope these observations will help .Read more; Value for money : 4 / 5Sound quality : 4 / 5Durability / Build quality : 4 / 5Bass quality : 4 /5Noise cancellation : 4 / 5Overall performance : 4 / 5Before judging any pair of earphones make sure to :(A) Install a good audio/music player with equaliser .

ANC does fine. Superior sound quality. One can compare the clarity to jbl live 770  NC which I use along side. Needs little tweaking through jlabs app. I found sound clarity to be nice with a good soundstage too for this price. App supports updates too and got an update immediately after connecting for the first time. Ear cuffs are designed uniquely than any other over the ear headphones. One little issue with the ear cuffs though, it gets really hot around ears after some time and we sweat heavily. That issue may be because the muffs provided covers entire ear with a very snug fit. Earmuffs are soft and durable. Battery life is amazing. Haven’t charged even once since started burning in. It’s been more than 30 hours playing on 70% volume with ANC on and still the battery shows 60 %. Over all good built quality is good even though made of plastic and doesn’t feel cheap. Bluetooth connection is great and supports google fast pair. Haven’t noticed any lag or disconnection ever.

But I have used Boat Rockerz which my friend has , And I can say without a doubt , Giving 200 more for this one is definitely worth it.The comfort , the looks , the loudness , the RGB (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). I even got 129 cashback so it had to be a steal deal for me 😁.I'm so glad I bought this as my first headphones. I was very skeptical but now that I'm using it 😍 , Its just a wonderful experience.Most negative comments I believe are one in hundred Instances or anomaly or exceptions. Most people DON'T review a product till it's defective. Only very few people review when the product it perfect.This is to help first timers like me or for anyone who want a good headphone.Don't worry bout anything , just go for it. Luck can be bad sometimes nd you might get a bad piece , just get it replaced nd voila , problems solved. Its not like 100% of manufactured products are bad ☠️. Anyway. Ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.; Great Budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together. Great build quality. Great fit can put straight for 2 to 3 hours, after it might feel a bit discomfort, depends on person to person. Great battery, brand claims 40hr and i get too around 38 to 39hr in it which says its approved for long hours. Very good sound quality, if you are confused between two headphones in this budget and you like BASS more, then pick this one it has great bass. So everything is good, but there is one major, very big problem which is kinda aceeptable for someone and not for a lot of pepole. The problem is Sound leakage, if you listen even above 50% vol or for some songs even at 30% vol, the sound starts to get outside earphone. your experience won't get bad for urself but the outsiders could also hear it which is why its not good to use it in public. if u go on 90% volume, rather than a headphone it becomes a speaker, u won't face any problem in ears, but voice outside will come loud easily hearable. It means brand gave everything, but could not block the speakers towards the outer end meaning voice gets outside easilyRead more; Great Budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together.

I got it for a nice deal (approx. Rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). I was reviewing multiple headphones under the Rs. 5k range. My first choice was the Sony CH-520, but I did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and I didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under Rs. 5k). The other options were Boat, Zebronics (a different set), Hammer and a variety of other ones.Among them I did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. I wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. It was available at a reasonable price and the RGB lights impressed me. So I ordered them.PROS:- Sounds good! I'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. No issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. The bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- Sturdy. The headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. While laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. I have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. They are still in good shape- RGB. The lights are definitely funky. They look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- Battery. Applaudable battery without hesitation. I use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.CONS:- Mic. I've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. My peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what I just said- Huge cushions and ear muffs! The size of the muffs are simply too big. When traveling with the headphones on in buses, I like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. But this is simply not possibly with these headphones. The muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. When I try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. So I'm forced to sit rigid for a while- Terrible button placement. The power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. This makes it very hard to use the controls. I have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. It's so ridiculous that I stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- Bad USB-C connection slot. The USB-C connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other USB-C wires because it has a narrow deep opening. So my phone's USB-C charger doesn't fit in it. Only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. This means I always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackOverall decent pair. In my previous (edited now) review, I mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. After several days I realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. So, I have edited my review and updated the ratingCheers!Read more; 3.5/5I have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. I got it for a nice deal (approx.

Your ears won't have pain even after a longtime use.; I've been using the Hammer Blash Max headphones for a month, and they’re honestly a hidden gem. The sound quality is absolutely incredible – rich, deep, and crystal clear. The mic performs great, making calls smooth, and the sound isolation helps me stay focused on my studies. As a student, it's a perfect choice, especially when compared to brands like Noise or BoAt in the same price range. The premium feel of these headphones really stands out.What really sets the Blash Max apart is the design. The 180-degree rotation ensures they stay safe from damage when not in use, unlike other headsets that can break or tilt. The soft cushions and matte finish make long online classes and study sessions comfortable. Plus, they're ideal for outdoor activities, traveling, and gym workouts – they won’t fall off like buds, which is a huge bonus. Covering the full ear, they provide a much better experience than typical on-ear headphones.The build quality is fantastic, and the customer support team is quick and responsive if you ever need assistance. The only slight drawback is the charging time, but once charged, the call quality is premium and clear, and the music is immersive. What really impressed me is the touch controls – something you rarely find in other brands at this price. If you're looking for a durable, stylish, and functional headset, the Hammer Blash Max is the way to go!Read more; I've been using the Hammer Blash Max headphones for a month, and they’re honestly a hidden gem.

Design:The neckband boasts a sporty design, making it ideal for activities like gym workouts, cycling, or jogging. It’s more suited for an active lifestyle rather than a formal or classy look.2. Connectivity:While it lacks the ability to connect to two devices simultaneously and only supports Bluetooth 5.0 (instead of newer versions), it still excels in quickly pairing with the connected device. This makes it reliable enough to count as a positive.3. Music Quality:Considering its budget-friendly price, the music quality is decent. It offers a satisfactory listening experience for casual use.4. Durability and Build Quality:Although I’ve only had it for a week, the build quality seems superior compared to the low-grade products commonly found in the same price range. While it doesn’t have a premium look, it feels sturdier than typical budget options. I'll provide an update on its long-term durability later.Cons1. Battery Life:The battery life falls short of the company's claims, lasting only 3–4 hours. This isn’t uncommon for budget-friendly neckbands, as lightweight, high-quality batteries are typically reserved for premium models. However, the false advertising by the company is disappointing.2. Button Placement:The volume and power buttons are placed too close to each other, making it difficult to differentiate between them. This may lead to accidental call disconnections while adjusting the volume. Although it’s not a major issue, it can be inconvenient.Read more; The neckband offers a mix of pros and cons that you should consider before purchasing.Pros1.

Connectivity:While it lacks the ability to connect to two devices simultaneously and only supports Bluetooth 5.0 (instead of newer versions), it still excels in quickly pairing with the connected device. This makes it reliable enough to count as a positive.3. Music Quality:Considering its budget-friendly price, the music quality is decent. It offers a satisfactory listening experience for casual use.4. Durability and Build Quality:Although I’ve only had it for a week, the build quality seems superior compared to the low-grade products commonly found in the same price range. While it doesn’t have a premium look, it feels sturdier than typical budget options. I'll provide an update on its long-term durability later.Cons1. Battery Life:The battery life falls short of the company's claims, lasting only 3–4 hours. This isn’t uncommon for budget-friendly neckbands, as lightweight, high-quality batteries are typically reserved for premium models. However, the false advertising by the company is disappointing.2. Button Placement:The volume and power buttons are placed too close to each other, making it difficult to differentiate between them. This may lead to accidental call disconnections while adjusting the volume. Although it’s not a major issue, it can be inconvenient.; It's going to be a year I bought this product and now the left side bud is not working!!Read more; It's going to be a year I bought this product and now the left side bud is not working!!; Cannot complain. At this price range it is one of the best in business. Used this for over a year and a half but due to very rough use one wire broke (my fault) but it is extremely good in terms of sound quality, device compatibility and connectivity. I was pleasantly surprised that it supported dual device connectivity. I used to connect with my android mobile and my laptop at the same time. If a call comes on my mobile then the music playing from my laptop automatically pauses and vice versa. Great charge retention. No ANC (at this price do not expect ANC). 5 stars from me.Read more; Cannot complain. At this price range it is one of the best in business.

Amazing battery backup I only need to charge it once per week and I listen to music atleast 2 hrs everyday. The sound quality is great but you may need to use equilizers to adjust the bass since this one is specially designed for high bass. My OnePlus already provides different mode of audio settings depends on the use so no trouble for me. Durability is amazing. I dropped it 2 times from 5 ft and nothing happened not even a scratch but if you sit on it , it will break for sure. It's not water proof by the way, it can resist small drops of liquids whether sweat or water but I won't recommend these for gym . And it's on ear not over ear headphones. Prolonged use can hurt back of your ears.Read more; Bought this 3 months ago, am totally impressed.

One thing i understood after using these  cans both A & B. These both are parallely good in their own world having their own charateristic, though 650 twice the amount, it does meant that it should be better than 560S. Also, 650 has few things which 560 lacks. Both are kinda different feel and winner in their own segment.I tried both with Mac M1 Air 2020:560S:Drivability: Easily you can drive and has enough power to volume up fully.Sound: Has wider sound stage than 650 for sure, sounds broader and wider. This is flat sound by default, some feel it is boring, but the advantage is you can hear for longer time without fatiguing.Comfort: This is best comfort headphone i have ever tried, this is not too tight as 650 rather not too loose as HIFI man editions. This is correct tight, so you can lay your head in pillow and hear.650:Drivability: At 100% volume, yes it drives. but still external AMP is needed. (if you are having Mac Book Pro 2021+ model, you no need to buy external amp, I tried this 650 with my friend MBP 2021 model, it drives flawless and we even compared it with Fiio K5, i can confidently say MBP is enough to get the juice of 650).Sound:1. Has better mid and clarity on compared with 560S2. Sound stage is little narrow when compared with 560S3. In terms of Imaging this is winner than 560S and i think extra bucks matters here.4. Since this has strong mid(senneheiser is known for this). you will get fatiguing little easier than 560S.Comfort:Has tight clamping force so less comfort than 560S but it gives very little advantage in sound isolation though this is Open back.Conclusion:if you are short of money to buy external AMP, then 560S is the best open back headphone in this range.If you can afford more money to buy external AMP + balanced cable + likes senneiheiser signature, then 650 does its job for extra job.Better alternative for 560S based on real A & B experience:1. Without any doubt, HifiMan XS Edition is winner than 650 and 560S, but sure shot you need to buy AMP.2. HifiMan Sundara is better than 560S in terms of soundstage.So if you are kind of person who like enjoying details of sound, clarity, mids then HifiMan is best product out there.

The Bose modules are still performing excellently, and I always admire their superb quality.For my PC, I initially used Zebronics headphones along with the DTS:X Windows app. However, these headphones never satisfied my ears. After researching online, I narrowed down my options to Sony or Sennheiser to fulfill my audiophile needs.I visited a Sony showroom and tried their high-end ULT Sony headphones. The bass and noise cancellation were below average, and the on-ear experience was quite disappointing.After comparing the sound quality of Bose, Sony, and Zebronics, I decided to do more research. Eventually, I discovered that the Sennheiser Accentum or Accentum Plus might be a good fit for me. However, I found that wireless and noise-canceling headphones are never truly perfect across brands.After further exploration, I settled on the Sennheiser HD 560S headphones. I purchased them and tested the same song I had listened to at the Sony showroom. My first impression was that my decision to buy the Sennheiser HD 560S was absolutely correct.Priced at ₹12,000, these headphones offer:Absolutely crystal-clear sound quality.Bass that is above average, though not comparable to the Bose Acoustimass 5 home theater setup.When I watched the war scene from Unbroken in Dolby Atmos using the HD 560S, it reminded me of the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan with a similar impactful effect provided by the Bose Acoustimass 5.Listening to many A.R. Rahman songs on the HD 560S, I can confidently say these are the best headphones available in the ₹12,000 budget range.Over-ear comfort is much better than the on-ear Sony headphones I tried.The open-back design leaks a slight amount of sound outward, but the crystal-clear audio ensures a truly immersive experience without being disturbed by external noise.The cable length is sufficient for my PC setup.No issues with wireless connectivity or noise-cancellation confusion—just a pure, wired soundstage experience.The packaging was excellent, and Amazon’s delivery service was, as always, superb.Read more; I had two Bose Acoustimass 5 modules and one Polk Audio CS20 center channel for my home theater system for the past few years.

As someone who had never had open back headphones, I never really understood what it meant by a wider soundstage and feeling airier.After using these for a few months I must say I was blown away, the open back style does give a great feeling that the sound is around you, rather than the sound coming from next to your ears, the headset is comfy to wear, light and well adjustable. There is some clamping at first, but this is to be expected, and they will eventually loosen, or you can rest them on something for a few hours to stretch the headband.Overall, they do everything I need, prodividing good bass, nice treble, and generally being a great pair of headphones for movies, games and music.The price is great, I got mine on sale for £100 but I would argue that even when not on sale they are still worth their money. I have not tried them on a mobile device, but straight to my PC they work well without the need of an AMP.The cable is a decent enough size, the headset itself seem sturdy whilst being lightweight, so it seems to tick all the boxes.If you are planning to purchase these headphones, I would suggest looking at audio software to use to better ehance the sound. There are simple guides online (I use Peace with a preset I found) and it enhances the sound, but straight out of the box they're great sounding.The downside is that being open back if you are in a busy area they will not block out the external sound, but this is not an issue for me but is something to consider.Read more; As someone who is a casual gamer, enjoys watching movies and listening to music, I wanted a pair of headphones that would provide good sound quality, as well as being comfortable to wear for long periods of time.I had done a lot of research when looking at headphones to buy, the main 2 I saw were the DT990 Pro (Closed Back) and these 560s (Open Back). As someone who had never had open back headphones, I never really understood what it meant by a wider soundstage and feeling airier.After using these for a few months I must say I was blown away, the open back style does give a great feeling that the sound is around you, rather than the sound coming from next to your ears, the headset is comfy to wear, light and well adjustable.

Their open-back design delivers a spacious, detailed listening experience, making them perfect for critical listening and music enthusiasts. Comfort is another strong point, they’re lightweight and well-padded, making long listening sessions enjoyable. If you value accuracy and a true-to-life sound signature, I highly recommend these headphones.Read more; The Sennheiser HD 560S headphones are a fantastic choice for anyone who appreciates natural, acoustic, and highly realistic sound.

Il timbro sonoro è diverso dalla linea 600 e 500 della Sennheiser. Queste cuffie sono effettivamente piu' analitiche e hanno un'ottima scena sonora che mi ha veramente sorpreso. La timbrica è meno calda della serie 600 e in certi momenti sembrano quasi degli IEM di altà qualità dando un senso di maggior definizione degli strumenti. Ho letto recensori che si lamentano di bassi invadenti, ma in realtà a me sembrano perfettamente equilibrati e mai sovrastanti o ""sbordanti"" sui medi. Mi piace il fatto che non siano bombastici come molte cuffie di gamma bassa come queste. I medi sono ottimi anche loro e le voci dettagliate e pulite. L'unico appunto che faccio a queste cuffie è un'eccessiva enfasi sulle frequenze alte che pur non essendo affaticante, a me personalmente da un po' fastidio. Ad onor del vero questa ""secchezza"" degli alti era maggiormante presente all'inizio degli ascolti, mentre piano piano con il passare delle ore sembra meno evidente. Se devo essere sincero non rimpiango le Hifiman che comunque tendevano anche loro ad enfatizzare un po' gli alti e a ""colorare"" un po' i medi. Per contro mi sembravano piu' ""reattive"" e dinamiche nelle transizioni musicali e nella ricostruzione della scena sonora (ma stiamo parlando di sottigliezze appena percepibili). Che dire, secondo me un gran paio di cuffie ad un prezzo abbordabilissimo. Io le consiglio a tutti coloro che vogliano una cuffia dall'ottimo rapporto prezzo/qualità.  Anche perchè per cuffie di un certo livello di prezzo consiglio sempre un ascolto diretto (no youtube e simili) perchè ce ne sono molte che suonano in maniera orribile o che comunque potrebbe non piacervi (al mio orecchio ad esempio le Grado sono inascoltabili, e le Beyerdynamic mi stancano...). I materiali sono plasticosi ma robusti il giusto e la comodità ottima.Bella sorpresa. Le usero' con piacere, anche perchè....a Natale non mi hanno regalato nulla!!!UmpfAggiornamento: le ho collegate ad un mojo 2 ed é accaduta la magia. Il suono ha preso vita e quella freddezza è precisione Dell'accoppiata col topping è sparita. Suoni caldi, corposi, rotondi, analogici. Una vera goduria. Quindi una cuffia da 150 euro che se accoppiata al giusto DAC può diventare una cuffia da 500 euro....Read more; Abbandonato dalla tecnologia ad ottobre (RME-ADI2 e Sundara morti...) e prevedendo un regalo Natalizio da qualche familiare per rimpiazzare le cuffie, ho optato per questo modello entry level, mentre per il DAC/Ampli ho optato per un Topping DX3pro+ (non comprato pero' su Amazon per via dei tempi biblici di consegna).Beh, sono rimasto piacevolmente sorpreso.

You can connect them straight to the laptop or phone, but they won't be so good.For their price I can say it's one of the best picks from quality/cost view.And as always (for me) amazon delivery was good. The package was delivered on time and it wasn't devastated.Read more; These are super comfortable, crystal clear sounding  referees headphones with good imaging and due to beeing good referees they are lacking some bass (when you run on ifi dac/amp with xbass/true bass the problem is gone, they are quiet good too for their price, and you'll need an amp +/or dac with amp sooner or later for these, so ifi does good job for not so much money).The only downsides is because of the low price the whole thing except the grill and drivers is plastic and you need amp to run them properly.

Great build quality. Great fit can put straight for 2 to 3 hours, after it might feel a bit discomfort, depends on person to person. Great battery, brand claims 40hr and i get too around 38 to 39hr in it which says its approved for long hours. Very good sound quality, if you are confused between two headphones in this budget and you like BASS more, then pick this one it has great bass. So everything is good, but there is one major, very big problem which is kinda aceeptable for someone and not for a lot of pepole. The problem is Sound leakage, if you listen even above 50% vol or for some songs even at 30% vol, the sound starts to get outside earphone. your experience won't get bad for urself but the outsiders could also hear it which is why its not good to use it in public. if u go on 90% volume, rather than a headphone it becomes a speaker, u won't face any problem in ears, but voice outside will come loud easily hearable. It means brand gave everything, but could not block the speakers towards the outer end meaning voice gets outside easilyRead more; Great Budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together.

I got it for a nice deal (approx. Rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). I was reviewing multiple headphones under the Rs. 5k range. My first choice was the Sony CH-520, but I did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and I didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under Rs. 5k). The other options were Boat, Zebronics (a different set), Hammer and a variety of other ones.Among them I did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. I wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. It was available at a reasonable price and the RGB lights impressed me. So I ordered them.PROS:- Sounds good! I'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. No issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. The bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- Sturdy. The headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. While laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. I have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. They are still in good shape- RGB. The lights are definitely funky. They look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- Battery. Applaudable battery without hesitation. I use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.CONS:- Mic. I've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. My peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what I just said- Huge cushions and ear muffs! The size of the muffs are simply too big. When traveling with the headphones on in buses, I like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. But this is simply not possibly with these headphones. The muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. When I try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. So I'm forced to sit rigid for a while- Terrible button placement. The power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. This makes it very hard to use the controls. I have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. It's so ridiculous that I stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- Bad USB-C connection slot. The USB-C connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other USB-C wires because it has a narrow deep opening. So my phone's USB-C charger doesn't fit in it. Only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. This means I always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackOverall decent pair. In my previous (edited now) review, I mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. After several days I realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. So, I have edited my review and updated the ratingCheers!Read more; 3.5/5I have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. I got it for a nice deal (approx. Rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). I was reviewing multiple headphones under the Rs. 5k range. My first choice was the Sony CH-520, but I did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and I didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under Rs. 5k). The other options were Boat, Zebronics (a different set), Hammer and a variety of other ones.Among them I did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. I wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. It was available at a reasonable price and the RGB lights impressed me. So I ordered them.PROS:- Sounds good! I'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. No issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. The bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- Sturdy. The headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. While laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. I have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. They are still in good shape- RGB. The lights are definitely funky. They look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- Battery. Applaudable battery without hesitation. I use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.CONS:- Mic. I've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. My peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what I just said- Huge cushions and ear muffs! The size of the muffs are simply too big. When traveling with the headphones on in buses, I like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. But this is simply not possibly with these headphones. The muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. When I try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. So I'm forced to sit rigid for a while- Terrible button placement. The power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. This makes it very hard to use the controls. I have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. It's so ridiculous that I stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- Bad USB-C connection slot. The USB-C connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other USB-C wires because it has a narrow deep opening. So my phone's USB-C charger doesn't fit in it.

Still hard to believe that such good quality branded earphones are available for 800 rupees.

Even high res & Dolby Audio content plays exceptionally well for such a tiny device.

They fit very well & provide a decent amount of ambient noise cancellation.For the price, these are a steal. Definitely worth having, even if as a back up pair of earphones.Highly recommended for those who want to experience the JBL sound quality for a super economical price point.Read more; In spite of being biased towards “OverTheHead” studio headphones, the JBL earphones were an impulse purchase, especially given the discounted price on amazon.

However, I was quite disappointed with the overall performance. The sound quality is not as good as I had hoped—it lacks clarity, depth, and bass, which makes listening to music or watching videos less enjoyable. The audio often feels flat, and the highs and lows are not well balanced. I had chosen JBL because of its strong presence in the audio market and positive reviews, but unfortunately, this particular product did not meet my expectations.I believe that for the price I paid, there are better options available with richer sound and better comfort. I was genuinely looking forward to enjoying music on the go, but this product has left me unsatisfied. I would appreciate it if JBL could look into improving the audio tuning and overall performance of this model in future versions.I am now looking for a proper earphone that delivers clear sound, good bass, and consistent performance—something I can rely on daily for both entertainment and calls. Hopefully, my feedback can help others make a more informed choice.Read more; I recently purchased a JBL earphone, expecting a high-quality sound experience based on the brand's reputation.

These headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.Let's start with the build quality. Imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. They weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. Yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.Now, I'm a reasonable person. Accidents happen. So, I contacted NOISE support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. What I got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. They dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).So, here I am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. The audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. My advice? Steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. Unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.For those seeking a more constructive alternative:Do your research! Read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.Prioritize build quality. Look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.Understand the warranty terms thoroughly. Don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.Remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. Choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.Read more; I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS.

Sennheiser Professional Audio HD 280 PRO Wired Over Ear Headphones without microphone,"₹7,490",4.2,B00IT0IHOY,https://www.amazon.in/Sennheiser-280-Over-Ear-Headphones-Black/dp/B00IT0IHOY/ref=sr_1_115?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.edMkW1_Rfix2wAdTYQiwu_TOI_82_JNgxY8-r94lhuf2Frh62uy3Z1VXH9dmopo-iJihLcPY8QliGsi2iewvEkRtBsVcpAZomHIo1WuHmbfuyBAwQVtE-wnW5fd2mKTBNSgAfUZEl1MuBRtSrGDeuLI4S0nLtKK3x68sEIA-x554kJstJZtikU59Bs-fwRVCiAHGOuCvcTBZsXRld4TaNOPscOyau8yw-GyGN_1qgzA.X949Cqe6-W7YjouJZ1Lqh4toCe0EVl09RT1u_o4bzC0&dib_tag=se&keywords=headphones&qid=1747130923&sr=8-115,"After a lot of research & comparisons with Studio Monitoring Headphones in this league, both price wise & functionality wise, between the Audio Technica ATH-M20x or 30x (a popular & formidable product) & the Sony MDR7506 (classic & iconic studio headphones), what finally made the choice for me was a super discounted deal on amazon for these Sennheiser HD280 Pro headphones! At 6.5k, they are way more than a steal.First impression, right as you open the box packaging, is of a premium, well built & heavy duty pair of studio headphones. Box contains the headphones, which come with an attached output cord in a 3.5mm Jack with a 6.5mm adapter & a Safety Instruction guide, that’s it . . .No muss, No Fuss!The cord length provided is just perfect for my usage. These headphones are primarily going to be used for Video & Audio editing on a Macbook Pro, for 4K & Dolby Vision content, so the max distance is usually a standard desktop or office table setup, so the cord length is sufficient.Overall, build & touch n feel quality is off the charts, especially considering the price & the other options available in the same price/features segment.As soon as you pick up the headphones, you know you’ve picked up a premium brand.Finally, the sound quality, is by far the best I’ve experienced till date on any “over the ear”headphones, which were bought for personal use. The audio levels are crisp & clean, totally studio quality. The Noise Cancellation feature is highly effective & makes tuning out from the world, when editing a music video, a cakewalk.Despite looking like heavy duty headphones, these are fairly lightweight & haven’t caused any major issues after a few hours of usage. The cup size is nice & large enough to cover an entire average sized ear.The only caveat so far is the shape of the overhead band, which is way too wide, especially on a bald narrow head, so they may look a bit funny, but it is an extremely small nit-picky thing in what is otherwise an exceptionally fantastic piece of audio equipment.Although it is just the first day of use, the purpose & functionality of the headphones has been a 10/10 for the sound quality, on all audio trials & tests so far.Whether you’re looking for a pair of headphones for professional audio recording/mixing/engineering work or just to plug into your home device & hear crisp, clean & balanced sound, these HD280 PROs are absolutely perfect. Extremely impressed & happy with the purchase. Two Thumbs Up!Read more; After a lot of research & comparisons with Studio Monitoring Headphones in this league, both price wise & functionality wise, between the Audio Technica ATH-M20x or 30x (a popular & formidable product) & the Sony MDR7506 (classic & iconic studio headphones), what finally made the choice for me was a super discounted deal on amazon for these Sennheiser HD280 Pro headphones! At 6.5k, they are way more than a steal.First impression, right as you open the box packaging, is of a premium, well built & heavy duty pair of studio headphones. Box contains the headphones, which come with an attached output cord in a 3.5mm Jack with a 6.5mm adapter & a Safety Instruction guide, that’s it . . .No muss, No Fuss!The cord length provided is just perfect for my usage. These headphones are primarily going to be used for Video & Audio editing on a Macbook Pro, for 4K & Dolby Vision content, so the max distance is usually a standard desktop or office table setup, so the cord length is sufficient.Overall, build & touch n feel quality is off the charts, especially considering the price & the other options available in the same price/features segment.As soon as you pick up the headphones, you know you’ve picked up a premium brand.Finally, the sound quality, is by far the best I’ve experienced till date on any “over the ear”headphones, which were bought for personal use.

Two Thumbs Up!; SOUND:I wanted something of a neutral sounding headphones.And I say that if you're more of a bass lover this might not meet your expectation butThis headphones are very good neutral sounding headphones means every frequency is well balanced. Lows-Mids-TrebleHigh end frequencies are little less compare to other headphones but the sub bass and bass quality is very good.I'm not a fan of more high end frequencies but to some users it might sound less energetic on that area compare to lets say beyerdynamic or audiotechnica headphones.Personally I like high end of this headphones because of the balance and not harsh highs , I can listen to it for a long time.And noise cancellation is also good.COMFORT LEVEL:At first these headphones might be little tight on your head and is the reason for noise cancellation also.The cups are comfortable and will cover your whole ears.The headphones will get comfortable to your liking after some time you can adjust the size with slider above the cups.BUILD QUALITY:At this price range I think the build quality is goodHeadphones are foldable and light.But the wire is non detachable and cable is heavy so I think I have to take care of it and not be reckless about it.So I don't think these headphones are made for walking and listening typeThese are made for sitting in one place and listening type.FINAL VERDICT:I make music and I heard that most of mixing engineers use this to mix their beats so I ordered itI like this headphones because it met my expectations.At first you might not be able to grasp the sound stage of these headphones because you might not used to these type of headphones.Sound quality is good and almost neutral.I am not using these as my headphones for gym and I am not taking it with me when I go outside.It's not like you can't take it outside , the headphones are light weighted but cable is heavy and non detachable that's why.After using it sometime and grasping the sound stage, I can listen in this headphones for hours and pick little details in the songs too.So read this and based on your application you can choose whether to take it or not.Note: I saw the pictures online of this headphones and I found that that were two models.One is old one where on back of the cup of headphones,  Sennheiser hd 280 pro 64 ohms is writtenSecond is new model where only HD 280 PRO is writtenSo don't get confused with the images shown when you receive these headphones and don't find Sennheiser 64 ohms written on back of the cups.Cheers!Read more; SOUND:I wanted something of a neutral sounding headphones.And I say that if you're more of a bass lover this might not meet your expectation butThis headphones are very good neutral sounding headphones means every frequency is well balanced.

I've been frustrated why so many companies try to save a few cents making such thin cords that break in a few months only to lose money replacing them on warranty. This actually has a cord built to last and it's coiled so it's flexible. The cord is a bit short though for my setup so I use a cord extension to make sure it doesn't get tugged and damaged.I'm not an audio professional but the sound quality is amazing to me and a lot more natural sounding. The bass it has feels like having a subwoofer. The frequency response is rated for 8 Hz but from my testing at typical listening volume levels it can only noticeably play tones as low as 11 Hz, which is still pretty good. It also surprisingly blocks out a lot of outside noise too, about half as much as the hearing protection I use at work.I also love that they're comfortable and so adjustable. I like to pull one side behind my ear while singing so I can hear myself and they still fit to my head perfectly.Read more; I got tired of buying cheap headphones that break easily and don't regret paying extra for these at all.

Previously I used Sony headphones but they're entry-level headphones.  I also used headphones from other brands like Sennheiser, One Audio and JBL but all of them are entry-level headphones. This is the first time I bought high-end headphones and I trust Sony. You can't go wrong with Sony as per my experience. Coming to the headphones, I already knew that these were best. However, I researched thoroughly on YouTube and read many articles for almost 3 months before buying these. I want to get the best value for the price. These headphones are costly and I don't want to go wrong with my purchase decision.Build quality: These are made of high-quality plastic and feel lightweight and comfortable to wear for longer durations. The only thing is, that the headband is thin and hurts a little on my head after wearing it for a few hours. Just move or adjust it a little and I'm good to go for another hour.Sound quality: It's Sony, no need to brag about sound quality. Sony is known for sound clarity. Every small musical instrument is heard in great detail. I can't forget my first experience of listening to music using these headphones. I'm blown away by the details and the clarity of sound.Battery life: It is mentioned 30 hours. Seems to be true. Headphones will easily last up to two days of mixed usage.Noise cancellation (N.C.): These headphones are my first experience with noise cancellation. When NC is turned on, it is silent. Zero noise. But after a few days,  I realised that I could still hear voices from other people when they were shouting or talking loudly. It's good not to completely block all sound.Update on N.C.:I want to address one thing people who are saying that NC is not good. I think they feel like that because of the adaptive NC feature in the Sony headphones app. Due to this feature, the level of Noise cancelling is adjusted automatically according to the surroundings. I know it doesn't work 100% accurately every time. It works sort of 70 - 80 % accurately depending on the surroundings. That's why some people complain that NC is not completely silent or perfect. Some are complaining there is no option to disable the adaptive NC feature. It is available in the Sony headphones app after the latest update. We can also manually disable the adaptive NC of headphones using the app. I mentioned these details because some people may not be aware of these features available in the headphones app.Note: When NC is turned on, a sound pressure is created between ears and headphones. So there is a vacuum-like seal between ears and headphones and it blocks external sound. I'm not sure how NC works. This is the first time for me experienced noise cancellation. It was a shock and a surprise feeling when NC was on. My brother got scared due to this effect. I got used to it now. Check the Sony manual regarding the safety of NC. In the Sony Headphones Connect app, there is a safe listening setting. Please follow it and you don't need to worry about your ears getting damaged due to headphones. I have attached screenshots of the same. Please check.Final Verdict: I can say that these headphones are the best consumer headphones.

Audiophile headphones are different that's why I mentioned them as the best consumer headphones. Most people who use them will love them.; I had been an AirPods Pro user and was always of the belief that they have the best music reproduction with lossless audio from apps like Apple Music. Was seriously wanting to try the XMs when the XM4 was launched but wasn’t happy with the reviews of mic quality as I generally take calls for more than 7 hours on my work days. But when XM5s came in was tempted to try them after the reviews paying more details on the improved mic quality. I wanted to give it a try and tried the music when I was in France in a store, but the sound quality was very poor since the store let me use it only with their wired audio source and said NO to try with my phone. Back in India I tried again once in a store using my phone and Apple Music and Boy o Boy I was proved wrong!!! I was simply blown over on how the headphones were clear with the Spatial Audio even with the default EQ setting. I’m not a bass heavy person but rather love the different tones and this is a Pro quality one in that. With the ANC microphones it was even a blessing that the call trials(both with MS Teams and Phone) I did were fantastic. Decided to grab this and ordered in Amazon when it was available for around 28K net with cashback and I would say this is the best investment I had made. The dual connectivity, monstrous battery back up, ANC combined with the best mic makes it a great headphone one can ever have. The size and case as most say as negative isn’t a problem at all. The build also is good and this is a keeper. If you are not worried about the budget and need a headphone that u can use for both work(calls) and music blindly go for this.. 👍🏻Read more; I had been an AirPods Pro user and was always of the belief that they have the best music reproduction with lossless audio from apps like Apple Music.

As per all reviews these are one of the best but you need to keep your expectation realistic. You can easily hear person talking at moderate volume in same room( reduce by a bit ) or even to next room if someone it talking loud or moderately loud.But if in next room people are talking a moderately low volume you wont hear them same is for tv, at high volume you will definitly hear it.( you can play some white noise or music than you minimise other noise.)what more to consider: These cut other background noise like of ac ( almost completely ) , birds, other typical noises. It can get little uncomfortable( unnatural silence 😂) for some in begining. you also hear people because it cut other backgroud noise so much that even little things are more highlighted.for other: If you are buying these for listening music and watching movies while travel It will cut every thing while playing music or movies. Maybe these are designed for this purpose.Pass though mode: As per my opinion its great , almost natural with no delay,Battery I didnt tested extensively that how much time it can go but I feel more than sufficient  easily last for  couple of days  if using 5-6 hours a day, charging is also fast so no worries there.Biggest bummer for me. Its no surprise that there is no dolby atmos support. I think for this price it should be there, As sony 360 audio is not supported at all platforms n very less content is available. so for spatial audio doby should had been there. I had used other product with dolby it makes huge impact.Read more; 4 star rating just for bad packing from seller as there are no packing material on the box. seller slapped bill on original box. for such premium device it is disappointing.Build and design: I had used these headphones for more than week and I would say device is very comfortable for longer use ( watching movies) , quite light weight , controls are easy to use, touch response is fast with almost no delay.Audio: Well I am not used to over the ears devices so I cant compare to others but its great overall. bit bassy for my liking and little less bright u can say but it can be easily fixed by eq. so no problems there ( may be brand had tuned it for more neutral profile) .After eq tuning these are mostly excellent for songs , movies podcast etc.also audio quality depends upon you device too. as I tested it on low end mobile and high end devices, u can observe difference.noise cancellation:  I bought these for work at home , typically coding, study research papers , as people can get really vocal and for analysing complex articles you need silence. As per all reviews these are one of the best but you need to keep your expectation realistic. You can easily hear person talking at moderate volume in same room( reduce by a bit ) or even to next room if someone it talking loud or moderately loud.But if in next room people are talking a moderately low volume you wont hear them same is for tv, at high volume you will definitly hear it.( you can play some white noise or music than you minimise other noise.)what more to consider: These cut other background noise like of ac ( almost completely ) , birds, other typical noises. It can get little uncomfortable( unnatural silence 😂) for some in begining. you also hear people because it cut other backgroud noise so much that even little things are more highlighted.for other: If you are buying these for listening music and watching movies while travel It will cut every thing while playing music or movies. Maybe these are designed for this purpose.Pass though mode: As per my opinion its great , almost natural with no delay,Battery I didnt tested extensively that how much time it can go but I feel more than sufficient  easily last for  couple of days  if using 5-6 hours a day, charging is also fast so no worries there.Biggest bummer for me.

Still have not gone through all the features, functions, and app but based just based off the sound alone I am extremely satisfied; Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Industry Leading Noise Cancelling Headphones with Auto Noise Cancelling Optimizer, Crystal Clear Hands-Free Calling, and Alexa Voice Control, BlackWell I finally felt time to upgrade my headphones. I've been using the old Boss quiet comfort 3's.  Quite dated I know. But it lasted me a very long time.  It's done well for meNow after much time passed I finally picked up this Sony xm5.My comparison is with that old headphone.  Perhaps not the best apples to apples fairness.  I don't look for studio reference flat sound with these . I look daily music listening whilst working. Something to work out with.  Something that has good enough clarity in highs and deep bass for pop music.  My high fi lilistening is done by wired headphones which is a total other category of audiophile gear.For these I need superb noise cancelling that is superior to Bose .  I need exciting lively bass tightness and crispy highs without harshness.  A good mic for conference calls.  An ambient mode to use when jogging.This Sony xm5 delivers and TLDR I can easily replace my Bose qm3 with these.1. Sound .  First thing I noticed immediately... This has ultra tight bass .  Bass is as deep as you want it. And can be set to create a super tight quick reacting bass.  Very satisfying in all musical genres.  Wayyy exceeds Bose bass performance which IMO was its weakest point .  By default thigh highs are flat and lifeless but after a super quick EQing session I got it to my preferred listening and it sounds amazing.  I'm very happy with the sound. It feels smooth and unfatiguing when I want it... And then it can be eq'd to be clinically sharp but not harsh.... Whenever you feel like it.  It is hands down a huge step above Bose.2. Noise cancelling.  TLDR?  Huge upgrade over Bose qc3.  It's dead quiet.  It is scare silent actually... Really eerie.  I love this because I turn it on and just use it as a way to work I'm office without the hum of the hvac system.3. Ambient mode.  The Sony app allows you to adjust the levels to satisfy how much exterior sound to leak into your headphones. I like this.  It also allows you to setup detection mode to allow you to swap to ambient mode automatically when you talk and have conversations.... Music stops.  After 15 seconds the ambient mode reverts back to noise reduction mode and resumes music.  Really handy.  Love it.3. Mic for conference calls.  Absolutely outstanding without premature cutting off of voice which is a common issue with these headphone mics... Bose suffered from this greatly.  This is crystal clear mic and no issues using this in professional conference calls.4.  Tap controls.. very simple straight forward. Uses a swipe or tap setup on the right ear.  The entire right side ear flat side is a drawing board .  Large surface area makes for superbly reliable gestures that make it consistent and easy to control.  Swiping up and down is volume.  Swiping fwd or back is tracks.  Double tapping pause and resumes.  Theres no way to adjust the gesture actions on the app. .nor is there a way to make the left side become gesture side in case you prefer left side .... It's ONLY right side.  To me it is not a show stopper but perhaps for others it could be. The only other buttons is the ANC button to toggle noise cancelling mode and ambient mode.  You can program double or triple clicking of the button to launch Spotify or other music apps but I only use double tap for Spotify.  The other button is on/off / pairing.  This isn't customizable.  I would have liked to see a bit more customizable actions here but it's OK... Sometimes it's better to have more simplicity.  Oh by the way you can turn OFF the tap swipe gestures entirely  case you find this to be annoying with accidental taps especially when You're wearing the headphones laying down5. Automatic modes.  Based on location , you can have your phone help detect location and automatically set your profile for you. Example if you're working , set noise cancelling ... Or if it detects jogging then setup ambient mode . Etc... handy but not something I would use.  I like to be in control.6. Comfort.  This is a really light weight product. Very comfortable. Wraps FULLY account ear.  Theres no issue with long wear time because it's so light and feels great.  The vinyl material wraps the  foam and doesn't feel sweaty .  You can replace this with other materials ( third party).  Lots out there.  I really wished there are larger Labelling of L and R to quickly visually see which side is right.  It's a tiny little R on the inside of the headphone head piece ... The BOSe had a huge R and L on the inside of the headphone ear foam so it's hidden front he outside but still stealthy.  I get that Sonys design for these headphones are minimalist stealthy look but the R and L could've been larger and still stealthy.7. This uses USBC. And charges quick and lasts a long time.  Whilst not as long as my Bose,  it's long enough for me to be reliable to last me entire day and MORE. no problem. I have no issues here.  It's fantastic.8. The Sony connect app is clean and easy to use.  It's what unlocks the Sony headphones to another level.  Much better than Bose software.  You need it for eq and various profiles .  Without it you're going to miss out.So to conclude I'm gonna give it huge 5 star rating. Rare for me.  It's a fantastic device.  Huge upgrade from my Bose qc3.  Really happy with this so far.  And what made it a great buy from me is I've found it in Amazon warehouse open box pricing.  You can't beat that .Hope this helpsRead more; Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Industry Leading Noise Cancelling Headphones with Auto Noise Cancelling Optimizer, Crystal Clear Hands-Free Calling, and Alexa Voice Control, BlackWell I finally felt time to upgrade my headphones.

I wear it several hours a day, throughout the week, mostly during calls and web meetings.  Sound quality is very clear on both ends. Inbound audio is super loud (way louder than any wired headset I’ve used), and people can hear me clearly too. Yes, you can tell I’m on a headset, but the clarity and volume are excellent.Set up was easy and straight forward, no surprises.Battery life is excellent so far—I get about two full days before charging it. I’ve never had to worry about quitting on me in a meeting. The charging dock/case is a nice touch, though I wish it charged while stored inside, not just while docked.Comfort-wise, it’s one of the best I’ve worn. Super lightweight, you can barely tell it’s there. No aching or tenderness even after long days. It comes with a bunch of ear tip sizes and shapes, which is nice, it took me a bit to find the one that worked best. Mid-size worked best for canceling out background noise without pushing it in to deep.Controls are straightforward—power, mute, volume—all right on the device. One small gripe: the power button is the same as the hang-up button. So if the other person hangs up first and you go to end the call, you might accidentally power the whole thing down. Not a a big deal once you get used to it.I’ve dropped it a few times and it still works perfectly—feels sturdy, not cheap at all. Easy to switch ears, too, which helps avoid fatigue.Bottom line: For $50, it’s a great deal I spend more on less quality pieces. So far I’m happy and can recommend this earpiece for sure.Read more; I’ve been using this earpiece quite a bit for the past 2 weeks now, and honestly, it’s amazing.

Covering the full ear, they provide a much better experience than typical on-ear headphones.The build quality is fantastic, and the customer support team is quick and responsive if you ever need assistance.

Nevertheless, if you experience distortion or quality issues, you can try changing the bluetooth codec as mentioned below.Samsung has its own codec too which it uses for its earbuds.UPDATE 30MARCH2025: (This post will help people as I see many reporting issues with connectivity/distortion/quality. )Mostly as I saw the reviews - issues reported were with distorted sound/quality of sound and with a set of devices and mostly people saying that it was seen with windows pc. I was able to fix the problem myself. PLEASE NOTE: There was no help from Noise. Noise tech did not help troubleshoot.).My ticket was just closed from Noise end and so I realised if I went back there again,  the device would just  go back and forth only but my problem would not get fixed. No one from Noise called me through the entire process to even understand the issue in detail or even when it was marked checked after sending it back for the first time.----TECHNICAL EXPLANATION---How I solved the issue - A common problem reported from multiple reviews was about distortion(sometimes written as quality) and was with some devices and then mostly with windows pc users. So, it cannot be that such a priced headphone will have substandard quality when some verified purchases reviews having 5 stars. The battery is good. So, some issue might be with the chipset hardware.""Codec"" is coding-decoding and a bluetooth codec is used to compress and decompress audio data for efficient wireless transmission. Depending upon the codec the quality of your sound differs.This device seems to be defaulting to AAC (advcd audio encoding) which apple devices use. I had to go to ""Developer Options"" in android (to enable ""Developer Options"" in Android please google it) and try another codec. I switched to SBC (Sub-Band Codec) on my phone which is a very old codec and is prone to losses, and then it sounded fine. Attached two images for reference.for Samsung:1 Go to ""Settings""2 Tap ""About device"" or ""About phone""3 Tap “Software information”4 Tap “Build number” seven times. ...5 Enter your pattern, PIN or password to enable the Developer options menu.6 The ""Developer options"" menu will now appear in your Settings menu.PLEASE NOTE: YOUR PHONE NEEDS TO BE CONNECTED/PAIRED WITH THE HEADSET FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE BLUETOOTH CODEC OPTION IN YOUR ""DEVELOPER OPTIONS"" IN ANDROID. IF YOU ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE HEADSET, THE OPTION FOR CODEC SELECTION WILL BE GRAYED OUT.But upon shutting down and turning back on after few hours, when it pairs again, the setting goes back to AAC at times. Its a pain changing it again when you disconnect and reconnect back.On PC its completely distorted. Windows does not allow to change codecs. Based on what I found, it does not have selections like we have for Android. I will keep looking for a way to change it.Whichever manufacturer the chipset is being imported from, is having different codecs than samsung android.UPDATE 29MARCH2025:I received the headphones back from noise and they just sent back the same thing in broken state.I cannot imagine why a company is doing this. It's like ""here its back again but just in a diff box""Now again open a ticket and then send back item. Why did i purchase this from amazon in the first place. I should have gone to a shop purchased it. Atleast would not be facing this.Complete utter disregard to customer. Its customer problem. Let him be with a broken thing.========================Never seen such worse quality by paying this much money. Sound distorted right out from the box. Listen to audio -spotify or anything, even phone call, sound is heavily distorted. Any other of my old bluetooth headphones and earphones are fine. Breaks heavily in between. I do not know how even people gave it 5 stars. But if you hear a music, its as if like the audio tape is getting stuck in between.Not worth the money. Defective in sound right from the box. Never seen such bad quality that too for a higher priced item.And to top it, Amazon's stand is this has to be taken up with noise only.

Got these an attractive price in Feb 2025.1. Sound: The quality of sound / clarity is impressive, balanced and clear across bass, mid and treble. The bass is a passive bass (rich in tone but no physical vibration as I understand it means). The default bass is a bit rich for me so I toned it down using the EQ in the Bose App. Other than that, the rest is crystal clear to my ears.2. Active Noise Cancellation: Not seen better ANC in this price range. QC Ultras take it up a couple of notches with intelligent ANC adjusting to ambience. You can customise as per needs using modes. The “ANC level” control is no more accessible as a button, but instead is now set in “modes”. You can add any number of custom modes and mark some modes as favourites and the favourites can be toggled through using the multifunction button, when in use.If you want to simply tune out of the world with nothing playing on the device/ headphones, that works too. Silence.3. Designed for comfort and fit: Lightweight with a cushioned headband and ear pads hinged to an articulated aluminium frame, QC Ultras are designed well for long listening sessions avoiding ear fatigue.4. Battery Life: Upto a day on music, with a quick charge feature when needed.5. Connectivity: The Bluetooth 5.3 is enabled, and it can toggle between two devices at the press of a button (say, phone and laptop).6. Functionality has changed from previous generations with the volume control enabled through a capacitive-touch rib at the back of the right ear pad.7.Spatial audio is an addition. The spatial audio effect is easily observable. But, some fixing is needed to make the sound as good as when using without spatial audio. Maybe a firmware/software update coming soon?Bose QC Ultra headphones are superior for ANC, comfortable wearing, and sound clarity.Read more; QC Ultras are being quoted as Bose’s best ANC headphones to date.

Previously, I owned the Sony WH-1000XM3, which was excellent.This model is undoubtedly an upgrade in terms of sound quality, fit, and noise cancellation. However, I did encounter one unusual issue—Bluetooth remained connected for hours even after removing the headphone, instead of disconnecting and entering sleep mode as expected. It happened only once, so it’s hard to say whether it was a firmware glitch or just a rare occurrence. Unfortunately, this did result in some battery drain.I purchased the Bose 60th Anniversary variant for around ₹25,000, which was certainly a great deal.Read more; After using the Bose QuietComfort Ultra for a month while traveling by flight and bus, as well as at home, I’m sharing my review.

La réduction du bruit est juste étonnant, bien au-dessus des AirPods Max, même dans des environnement bruyant assez difficile (vent). Niveau confort, c’est un sans-faute : il est super léger, ne fait pas mal à la tête, même après des heures d’écoute, et s’adapte parfaitement au personne qui porte des lunettes (ce qui n’est pas le cas de tous les casques).Côté son, il y a pas mal de basses a la sortie de boîte mais avec l’égaliseur de l’application (très simple à utiliser), on peut régler ça comme on veut. Résultat : un son riche avec et agréable pour tous les styles de musique, par contre j’ai pas ressenti une grosse différence avec l’Aptx adaptatives et sans et le côté immersion plus artificiel que autre chose. La housse rigide fournie est super pratique, bien meilleure que celles des QC45 ou AirPods Max qui est une blague.Je l’ai aussi testé pour le gaming : nickel en solo, mais à éviter pour les jeux multi à cause d’un petit décalage. Au final, ce casque est une réussite, polyvalent et bien pensé.

The vocals are clear if you increase your volume to 50% + but it does have a con will share in a moment- if you are under 20 age with small to medium head then it is suitable for you :)- yes the SD card works very well just make sure your SD card is clean and only has .mp3 files.-Gamers you can go for it if you don't play sports! Then go for it, Emin gaming mode it has very minimal latency which unfortunately I can't count but yeah I play a lot of games so it is working very well, you can play in 80% volume no leakage :) depends on the game also! The aux cable and gaming mode both works equally same and is really good :)- Voice call quality is 8/10 :)CONS:-if you have bigger head don't buy it, it will fit your head easily but then the cushions will start hurting in 3-4 hours so yeah like I have medium to bigger head so it hurts a bit after some hours-Cushions doesn't absorb any sweat!- it has sound leakage issue so basically above 60% or above 50% the sound comes out!

Calling not that good not calling not recommending for calling good for gaming, office and college use and music.Previous:- Sound is good but its leaking if you turn volume more than 30 its easily start leaking but you can use in noisy places like bus train etc there it should be fine. Build quilty is just 3/5 don't expect much. Calling is not good in bus and noisy place enc is useless. I wont say anything about cushions as its just arrived but it won't feel that tuff quality so its basically average. I bought it in 799. I think it's ok with the price they should lower down prices more.",headphones,8

Die Polsterung an den Ohrmuscheln ist angenehm weich, was auch bei längerem Tragen keine unangenehmen Druckstellen hinterlässt. Der Kopfbügel lässt sich gut anpassen, sodass es bei mir (auch bei längeren Sitzungen) immer bequem sitzt.Klangqualität:Die Klangqualität ist für ein Headset dieser Preisklasse mehr als ausreichend. Die Gesprächsqualität ist klar, ohne Verzerrungen. In Gesprächen wirkt die Stimme natürlich und deutlich, ohne dass ich mich zu laut oder zu leise anhöre.Mikrofon:Das Mikrofon ist flexibel und lässt sich leicht anpassen, um die beste Position zu finden. Es filtert Umgebungsgeräusche gut heraus, sodass meine Gesprächspartner immer klar verstehen, was ich sage – auch wenn im Hintergrund mal etwas mehr Geräusch ist. Der integrierte Windschutz hilft zusätzlich, störende Nebengeräusche zu minimieren.Software-Kompatibilität:Ein weiterer Vorteil ist die nahtlose Integration mit Microsoft Teams (MS in der Modellbezeichnung), was für mich als Teams-Nutzer ideal ist. Mit den dafür optimierten Tasten auf dem Headset kann ich schnell Anrufe annehmen oder ablehnen und die Lautstärke steuern. Die Plug-and-Play-Funktion ist ebenfalls ein Pluspunkt: Das Headset lässt sich problemlos anschließen und sofort nutzen.Fazit:Das Jabra Evolve 20 MS Stereo bietet ein ausgezeichnetes Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis. Es ist ideal für den täglichen Einsatz bei Video- oder Telefonkonferenzen und auch für den Einsatz in Büros oder Homeoffice. Der Tragekomfort und die klare Klangqualität haben mich überzeugt. Wer ein zuverlässiges und einfach zu bedienendes Headset sucht, wird mit diesem Modell sicher zufrieden sein.Read more; Als jemand, der viel unterwegs ist und regelmäßig in virtuellen Meetings ist, war mir besonders wichtig, ein Headset zu finden, das sowohl eine gute Klangqualität als auch eine hohe Gesprächskomfort bietet – und das Jabra Evolve 20 MS Stereo erfüllt diese Anforderungen hervorragend.Design und Tragekomfort:Das Headset ist recht schlicht und funktional im Design.

Cushions could have been softer and sweat absorbing- if using in an air conditioned room, this isn't a prob.Felt this was little heavier compared to the one I used earlier - Sennihiser and Sony headphones I used were a little expensive.Problem comes if you travel with this-bulk it is.I prefer a foldable over-the head. Headbands are adjustable but if you change them frequently plastic will have a wear and tear.

The sponge covering torn of completely after 1 year of usage and one side of the headphone broke while taking them  off my head, Really like the audio quality. One more thing I like to include is the charging port, it's built very loosely, you have to bend the whole cable and keep it tight near the port to charge.Pros: Audio quality is just awesome, u can use these headphones while listening to music ans gaming(with aux cable) too.It's is really comfortable near the ears and ear doesn't hurts after 5-6hrs of continuous usage.Battery life is also good I used to charge once in 4-6days and mostly used bluetooth.I did paired(Bluetooth only) it with my laptop and mobile at same time but headphones only process one device sound at a time so I had to mute other time to time to shift onto devices. So u have to manage this thing.It pairs with device easily without any issue or without taking much time. The aux cable is good too not too tight or too loose just perfect.Head adjustment mechanism is kinda funny because the headphones moves side to side faster when u take headphones out of adjustment idk why, could be less friction.While gaming with aux cable on u can get 0 latency(no sound delay) and can differentiate between lefts and rights and it's really helpful.I don't know the weight of headphones but they feels light on head so u can play games or watch movies without headacheCons: Build quality, full plastic body with only metal strip on head adjustment band and the plastic quality is ok ok...(cuz it broke ;-;)Charging port is loosely fitted so you have to sacrifice your cable life spanCushion are comfy but the skin or we say covering starts to fall off after some time and the headphones looks like dog water.High latency in Bluetooth mode making it use aux cable while gaming only and if u dont have aux cable port in your device so just quit these headphones and look for something else.Looks too big on head so won't recommend for gym, walk usage.You came across whole review so here's ur cookie 🍪!Read more; Personal Feedback: I didn't like the build quality at all.

Secondly the battery life is amazing, on a single charge I use this for like 40-45 Hrs and it still doesn't stop! Sound quality is decent in these but it's not cheap at all, tho i would say the durability is below average in these, but it's totally fine for an average user. Most importantly the mic is trash, i bought one of these in 2021 which broke in 2024 so I bought it again in 2024 and in both of the models, the mics did not work and that's the only drawback of this Headphone.Read more; The best headphones in this budget, I'm 6'3 and I have a big skull and ears but these fit perfectly on my head and are very comfortable!

Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is almost fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). It is average in terms of gaming. If you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. You can buy this headphone for games like Minecraft. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.Thank you for reading. Just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.Read more; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition.

Although I am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. There is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. Which is a pity, but ah well. Can't have it all, can ya?Best bluetooth headphones at 799 for sound AND mic quality. And let's not forget comfort. Headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.Although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.Even though I have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  Even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. So if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these. But if you don't mind going for EARPHONES, then there are many better options available in terms of sound quality.Read more; Surprisingly exceeded my expectations.

The mic is good, i tested the mic on discord and calls...It's pretty well. Battery is superb as it's been two days since I they were 100% and now when am writing this review.....it's still at 90%. Sound Quality is good. Gaming is bit of controversial as some might find it good but lemme tell u one thing that the latency is always not good at this price point but these are good for any story mode games and ok ok for competitive games.Hope it helps☺️Btw I got them for 800 rs.Read more; These headphones are good for the price but there is only one major problem that is comfort...I mean that you will not be able to wear them for long sessions otherwise it's overall a banger considering it's price.

Build quality: (4.5/5) it's plastic is pretty good, I have got the black variant, so it's quite prone to scratches but I have also had a rough usage from the past 6 months so no complaints, the cushions (ear padding) is also great, no sweating over long usage or irritation. The padding on the head is also comfortable.2. Anc:(4/5) the anc isn't best but good in the segment. It can cut off the fan noise and other noises too.3. Transparency:(3/5) it's pretty basic, but makes the sound feel like it's on high frequency which sometimes can be irritating.4. Sound:(5/5) the sound is amazing, the app has 22 different presets and you can choose according to your likes. The base it also good. If you are a gamer then there is a little latency but not too much. If you are using aux then the latency I just 0. And the sound on aux is pretty standard and flat.(I would prefer music on blutooth)Battery: (5/5) the battery life on it is just amazing, I use for like 5-7 hours a day and charge it once in a week. And it charges fast too.Few extras: I have received 2 updates from the last 6 months and I have felt that the dual connection feature has been more optimized than before.Also the app ui is user friendly and goodIt also sometimes doesn't connect automatically when I turn it on but not a big deal.Overall:(4.5/5) I got it for the price of 3.8k and it's a amazing deal for the price.Read more; I have been using it since the last 6 months, and I would say that it's worth every penny I have spent on it, the breakdown of the rating is as follows:1.

Perfect Bluetooth connectivity with 2 devices. Switch between the audios is flawless. It allows me to switch between listening to music from mobile and connect to office calls. Sturdy design which looks premium. It has button controlls instead of touch, personally I like it this way as it won't have any accidental change of settings. Comfortable wear with soft padding. Decent bass. Soundcore app works fine as well. Charges quite fastCons: I don't think ANC is that effective as I don't feel any noticable difference between ANC-Normal-transparency mode. Sounds better in normal mode than in ANC. Supports Hi-Res audio via auxiliary cable, but didn't notice any significant difference(may be because I am not that big an audiophile). No carry pouch is provided, so need to be careful.Overall, it is a great headset with really good sound quality that does justice to it's price point.Read more; Pros: Has great low and mids.

They’re tight and feel sharp around the ears, not suitable for long use.Sound Quality: Just average. Bass is weak, vocals are flat, and overall sound is not immersive. Definitely not for music lovers or gamers.Battery Backup: Good battery life, but what’s the use if you can’t wear it comfortably?Latency: Claimed 45ms low latency – works fine for casual YouTube videos, but not ideal for fast-paced gaming.Verdict:Great looks, poor comfort, and average sound.

Amazing battery backup I only need to charge it once per week and I listen to music atleast 2 hrs everyday. The sound quality is great but you may need to use equilizers to adjust the bass since this one is specially designed for high bass. My OnePlus already provides different mode of audio settings depends on the use so no trouble for me. Durability is amazing. I dropped it 2 times from 5 ft and nothing happened not even a scratch but if you sit on it , it will break for sure. It's not water proof by the way, it can resist small drops of liquids whether sweat or water but I won't recommend these for gym . And it's on ear not over ear headphones. Prolonged use can hurt back of your ears.Read more; Bought this 3 months ago, am totally impressed.

I got the order today and the package is good without any damage. But the issue is with the earphones. The left earbud is producing static noise and the sound is low compared to right side. It's not like it started after a few days or months. It started on same day as I received the order and just a few minutes after I started using. I don't know if everyone is facing this issue (saw similar comments on YouTube and reviews) but this is causing very bad hearing experience. I assume it may be due to driver issue or wiring in left side. Request to please take note of this feedback for both buyers and the boat companyRead more; I purchased Boat Rockerz 255 Z Plus.

Highly recommended!; Wire earphones, also known as wired earphones or headphones, are a popular choice for many people due to their affordability, reliability, and compatibility with various devices. Here are some key aspects to consider when evaluating wire earphones:1. Sound Quality: The sound quality of wire earphones can vary depending on the brand and price range. Generally, they offer good audio performance with clear and balanced sound reproduction. Higher-end models may provide enhanced bass response and better overall audio fidelity.2. Comfort and Fit: The comfort and fit of wire earphones are subjective and depend on individual preferences. Some earphone models come with different sizes of ear tips or additional accessories to ensure a secure and comfortable fit. It's important to find a pair that suits your ears well to minimize discomfort during extended use.3. Durability: Wire earphones are generally more durable compared to their wireless counterparts since they don't have delicate electronic components like batteries or Bluetooth modules. However, the quality of materials used and build construction can still affect their longevity. Look for earphones with reinforced cables and sturdy connectors to ensure they can withstand daily wear and tear.4. Noise Isolation: Some wire earphones offer passive noise isolation by creating a seal in the ear canal, blocking out external sounds. This can enhance your listening experience, especially in noisy environments. Keep in mind that the level of noise isolation can vary between models.5. Connectivity: Wire earphones typically use a 3.5mm audio jack, making them compatible with a wide range of devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and audio players. However, it's important to check if your device still has a 3.5mm audio jack, as some newer smartphones have transitioned to wireless or USB-C audio connections.When choosing wire earphones, it's recommended to read customer reviews, compare different models, and consider your personal preferences and budget.Read more; Wire earphones, also known as wired earphones or headphones, are a popular choice for many people due to their affordability, reliability, and compatibility with various devices.

The ones with rubber tips become uncomfortable after extended use so wanted something without them.Previously I was using earphones from JBL, this is definitely a step down compared to it, but of course, Boat is cheaper.Here are some of my thoughts on the product:• Sound Quality: The sound quality of these earphones is above average, making them a great option for listening to music or taking phone calls. The bass is normal, which is neither too overpowering nor too underwhelming.• Noise Cancellation: One of the drawbacks of these earphones is that they do not have noise cancellation features. So, if you're someone who wants to block out external noise while listening to music, these might not be the best option for you.• Comfort: These earphones do not come with rubber tips, which makes them a great option for those who find rubber tips uncomfortable. They are easy to wear for extended periods without any discomfort.• Durability: These earphones are well-built and can withstand daily wear and tear. They also come with a tangle-free cord, which is a great convenience.Overall, these wired earphones are a great option for those who want something simple, functional, and affordable for daily use. While they don't have noise cancellation features, the sound quality is above average, and they are comfortable to wear for extended periods.

From the moment I received the product, it has been nothing but a headache. The headphones are completely defective – the Bluetooth feature does not work at all. I tried connecting them to multiple phones, including different brands and models, but the headphones simply refuse to pair. It’s clear that the product is faulty, and no amount of troubleshooting has made a difference.When I reached out to the seller for assistance, their response was utterly unhelpful. They provided no useful solutions or support, and it felt like they were just brushing me off. I then tried to initiate a return and refund through Amazon, only to find out that it’s not possible. How is this even acceptable? I paid for a product that doesn’t function as advertised, and now I’m stuck with it. It’s incredibly frustrating to feel like I’ve been scammed out of my money.To make matters worse, Amazon’s customer service was no help either. They were unable to resolve the issue and offered no real solution. It’s shocking that a platform as large as Amazon would allow such poor-quality products to be sold and then fail to support customers when things go wrong. The entire experience has left me feeling cheated and helpless.This purchase has been a total waste of time and money. The headphones are useless, the seller is unresponsive, and Amazon’s customer service is ineffective. I regret ever buying this product and will definitely think twice before making another purchase on Amazon. The lack of accountability from both the seller and Amazon is unacceptable.I would strongly advise others to avoid this seller and be cautious when shopping on Amazon. There’s no guarantee that you’ll receive a functional product, and if something goes wrong, you might be left with no recourse. Save yourself the frustration and shop elsewhere. This experience has been a complete disaster, and I will never recommend this seller or rely on Amazon for a resolution again.Read more; I am beyond disappointed with my recent purchase of wireless Bluetooth headphones from Amazon.

These headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.Let's start with the build quality. Imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. They weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. Yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.Now, I'm a reasonable person. Accidents happen. So, I contacted NOISE support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. What I got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. They dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).So, here I am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. The audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. My advice? Steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. Unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.For those seeking a more constructive alternative:Do your research! Read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.Prioritize build quality. Look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.Understand the warranty terms thoroughly. Don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.Remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. Choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.Read more; I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS.

It was between this and the Bose QC45 for me. My primary headphones for 8 years now are the Audio Technica ATH-M50x which are a solid pair of wired neutral headphones, so I'll use those as a reference for audio quality.Short read: Why I picked this over the Bose QC45 - sounds marginally better overall (with loads of room in the low end for those who like heavy bass), equally comfortable, better battery life, better app/customisability, and also a bit more discreet. I don't want people knowing I'm carrying around pricey headphones so I'd rather have a pair of plain looking Sonys than a Bose pair that screams expensive. Also, the carrying case is actually pretty great and protects these well. I wear these headphones everywhere, even at the gym.- Amazing battery: LDAC + DSEE Extreme on gives me a full week of use with 2-3 hours of use per day, at around 60-70% volume. Nice to not have to worry about charging these all the time (uses USB-C).- Audio: Super weird out of the box- very boomy and muddy low-mids. I EQd this and it went from sounding like an average set to an incredible one. It's just a bit bizarre to me that they'd hamstring this pair so severely out of the box when they're capable of so much more.It has great frequency response and articulation, you'll hear tons of detail once it is set up right, so credit to the drivers they're using. I'm including an EQ preset for your reference, which should be good for blues, jazz, folk, country, and classical (anything with nice vocals). Compared to the M50x, they have much better bass so anyone into EDM will like this set as well.- Comfort: They're wonderfully comfortable. Super light, doesn't clamp your head or ears, and you can wear them for hours. The cushions are soft and don't hurt your ears. Orders of magnitude more comfortable than my M50x, and easily the best other than the Bose QC line. You'll forget you're wearing them, they're that neat.- ANC: They completely block out low hums and noises coming from fans, ACs, and in-flight rumble, even with no music playing. Makes sense since they seem to be designed primarily as travel/commute headphones. Voices and other sounds can still kinda be heard but are drowned out if you're listening to music at anything above 30-40% volume. I don't think it's meant to block out these sounds, so I'm not particular about it. I can sit through an entire flight and hear nothing, which by itself is completely worth it to me.- Multipoint: works as advertised, I was able to use it fine with my Samsung Galaxy phone and Macbook pro upon testing. I don't use this feature though since I prefer LDAC and that is only possible with multi-point off. However if MP is useful for you, know that it works pretty seamlessly.Conclusion: If you can afford these headphones, I would easily recommend them to you. They sound genuinely amazing for a wireless closed back pair, are very customisable, comfortable, and the battery lasts for days, literally. The ANC is best-in-class and made for frequent travelers. It's one of those things that will last you years and years of use if you look after them. They also go on sale quite frequently, so wait for one before you buy (I got it for INR ~15,500). It's rare that I spend this much on a luxury item and still consider it a bargain.

You'll forget you're wearing them, they're that neat.- ANC: They completely block out low hums and noises coming from fans, ACs, and in-flight rumble, even with no music playing. Makes sense since they seem to be designed primarily as travel/commute headphones. Voices and other sounds can still kinda be heard but are drowned out if you're listening to music at anything above 30-40% volume. I don't think it's meant to block out these sounds, so I'm not particular about it. I can sit through an entire flight and hear nothing, which by itself is completely worth it to me.- Multipoint: works as advertised, I was able to use it fine with my Samsung Galaxy phone and Macbook pro upon testing. I don't use this feature though since I prefer LDAC and that is only possible with multi-point off. However if MP is useful for you, know that it works pretty seamlessly.Conclusion: If you can afford these headphones, I would easily recommend them to you. They sound genuinely amazing for a wireless closed back pair, are very customisable, comfortable, and the battery lasts for days, literally. The ANC is best-in-class and made for frequent travelers. It's one of those things that will last you years and years of use if you look after them. They also go on sale quite frequently, so wait for one before you buy (I got it for INR ~15,500). It's rare that I spend this much on a luxury item and still consider it a bargain. Cheers.Read more; I've lost 2 different pairs of in-ear TWS earphones (thankfully cheaper ones) so I decided to buy something large and harder to lose (lol). It was between this and the Bose QC45 for me. My primary headphones for 8 years now are the Audio Technica ATH-M50x which are a solid pair of wired neutral headphones, so I'll use those as a reference for audio quality.Short read: Why I picked this over the Bose QC45 - sounds marginally better overall (with loads of room in the low end for those who like heavy bass), equally comfortable, better battery life, better app/customisability, and also a bit more discreet. I don't want people knowing I'm carrying around pricey headphones so I'd rather have a pair of plain looking Sonys than a Bose pair that screams expensive. Also, the carrying case is actually pretty great and protects these well. I wear these headphones everywhere, even at the gym.- Amazing battery: LDAC + DSEE Extreme on gives me a full week of use with 2-3 hours of use per day, at around 60-70% volume. Nice to not have to worry about charging these all the time (uses USB-C).- Audio: Super weird out of the box- very boomy and muddy low-mids. I EQd this and it went from sounding like an average set to an incredible one. It's just a bit bizarre to me that they'd hamstring this pair so severely out of the box when they're capable of so much more.It has great frequency response and articulation, you'll hear tons of detail once it is set up right, so credit to the drivers they're using. I'm including an EQ preset for your reference, which should be good for blues, jazz, folk, country, and classical (anything with nice vocals). Compared to the M50x, they have much better bass so anyone into EDM will like this set as well.- Comfort: They're wonderfully comfortable. Super light, doesn't clamp your head or ears, and you can wear them for hours. The cushions are soft and don't hurt your ears. Orders of magnitude more comfortable than my M50x, and easily the best other than the Bose QC line.

It's rare that I spend this much on a luxury item and still consider it a bargain. Cheers.; I have been using these industry leading headphones by Sony, colour Midnight Blue, and trust me i find them worth every penny spent. Yes, i agree these headphones are highly expensive, some may say you can purchase Apple Airpods, Boss, Sennheiser, and other audio equipment options, but trust me nothing beats these bad boys.I am not a tech reviewer, but since being a musician, a music connoisseur myself and a huge fanatic of accessories such as headphones, earphones and smart gadgets, i can tell, these headphones are a revolution to the sound industry. I'll be quoting every pros and cons that i've personally come across and might help a few of you who decide to purchase this beauty.Pros:1. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC): Let's talk about people who love listening to their music without any external interference while working, walking, running, working out, during a flight, or any other mode where they'd use them, ANC is a boon. Switch to ANC, you'll have the minimum of the minimum noise entering your ears. Only sounds close to you can reach at a very low level, else wise, you won't feel a thing in your ear. Be prepared for some bashing from your parents when they scream your name on top of their voices, and you've got that ANC kicked in.2. 3 Ambience Sound Control (ASC) ON: Apart from the ANC, there are two more features that these bad boys offer.  ASC when active gives you a chance to listen to your surroundings at a certain level where you can be aware of people speaking, birds chirping, children hauling in the park, and other sounds. This feature enables one to understand the surrounding noises and doesn't feel isolated.3. Ambience Sound Control (ASC) OFF: When ASC is disabled or switched off, you can listen to your surrounding voices in a much denser state, ie. much more clearly in comparison to when the ASC is enabled. This feature is much similar to the ASC ON, just a slight difference of pitch and volume of the surrounding entering your ears.4. Head Phones Connect by Sony: Let's talk about the main functioning unit of these headphones, the app provided by Sony under the name of Head Phones Connect. You can download it from the App store if you are an iPhone user just like me, as well as from the play store for android users.This app is highly functional as well as quite intact providing a list of various functions such as adaptive sound control which is highly recommended to lazy people just like me. Once all set up, the app detects your actions and locations frequently, and switches the headphones settings automatically.In addition, if you are a daily user of these headphones just like me, the app tracks your daily attributes such as at what certain volume do you like listening you music, which mode do you mostly use, which location do you travel, and then adjusts the headphones as per your choice.One feature which at first startled me a lot but i really got impressed by it which is the Speak-to-chat feature. It's always annoying to either pull your phone out of your pocket and pause the music or to just pull off your headsets every time you need to talk to someone. This feature enables your headphones to pause automatically the instant you start speaking, and shall remain pause for about 20 secs and resume on their own if they do not detect any speech.For better sound quality, the app detects the size and shape of your ear through these headphones. This enables the device to perform better with distinct users.5. Motion Gestures: The right ear piece of the headphones has all the motion gestures such as taps for music pause/play, attend a call, play next/previous song and remove the headsets and the song pauses. These controls are highly helpful and can be easily learnt through the guide book provided, hence i won't dive deeper into it.6. Number of devices that can be paired at once: These headphones provide an option of connecting two devices simultaneously. You can connect these headphones to almost every device that has a latest and updated version of bluetooth/NFC. Devices that i've paired them with are iPhone, macbook, hp laptop, and android phones.7. What's in the box: The box comes with an impressive in-shape carrying case to carry these bad boys where ever you go. Also they include a C-type data cable for charging, 3.5mm jack cable which is quite long (haven't measured it honestly, but it is as long as a regular data cable), and a dual port 3.5mm jack converter, which so far i haven't tested.8. Battery Life: Well i must say that i am quite impressed with the battery backup these headphones provide. This device completely charges within 3 hours and trust me with an ON/OFF mode of playing music regularly, the battery stays up till 4-5 days, which is i bet a highly impressive feature which probably no other company audio equipment in this range might have.9. Voice Assist Functions: These headphones can be connected to google assistant, SIRI and alexa and perform really well.10. Easy access keys: The headphones are enable with two easy access keys on the left earphone. The custom key toggles between the 3 modes that i've already mentioned above which are guided by the in-built assistant voice. The power key pressed long enough, turns ON/OFF the device and pressed once, the in-built assist provides you with the current % of the battery left.11. Comfort: I should had talked about it earlier, but never mind. With no questions asked these headphones are highly comfortable, the cushion provided is the softest pad your ears can get. Since i am regular spectacle user, i find it hard with headphones imposing excessive pressure over the ears, making it a painful experience, but these headphones give a feather touch to your ears, even if you are specy or even while wearing a face mask. These go good with everything.12. Battery Saver: These headphones tend to power-off on their own if not in use for more than a minute which is a highly power efficient feature added by Sony to the device.Cons:1. If you are into running or any sort of longer workouts, be prepared for sweaty ears. Since the cushions on these headphones completely cover you ears, creating a vacuum sort of environment, no air flows in and out, and the sweat starts dripping down from the earphones, which i must state doesn't affect them at all, only can be slightly irritating sometimes.2. ANC can be difficult to be kept enabled every time since it reduces the environment sounds to almost negligible, which can be dangerous while running or walking at a buss street. Be very careful while using this feature. Probably it is made for environments such as while travelling in a bus or a flight, and seems suitable for these environments.3. Since these headphones can be simultaneously be connected to two devices at once, which is a boon, but is also a slight problem in disguise. Imagine your headphones are connected with your laptop as well as you phone. You are attending an important zoom call while on your laptop and the headphones are in action, your phone starts to ring, now abruptly you'll start hearing you phones ringtone, and the device gets a little startled to which device shall be entertained. i've personally faced this, but i tend not to connect them to two devices at once.PS: One highly important thing is, you won't get an experience of the sound through reading review or watching Youtube videos. You might get a fair image of weather to invest in them or not, but you'll only get the sound experience when you'll listen the music through these bad boys.Read more; I have been using these industry leading headphones by Sony, colour Midnight Blue, and trust me i find them worth every penny spent.

Multi-point feature adds convenience.; With cable they don't use any battery and of course the Sony headphone app with it's equalizer doesn't work then either. I've tried them with and without a DAC (iFi) and they really have a lot of well sounding to deliver to it's user - especially with Hi-Res Lossless and Atmos track. They are easily driven when connected to a computer and the sound was amazing. Breathtaking. I couldn't believe what I was experiencing. Finding nuances in songs I never have heard before. Yes, bluetooth is great but with the cable they really come alive. At least IMHO. As with my XM4 in ear, the bluetooth connection works great and with Sony headphones app (tried on iPhone and iPad) where you can fine tune the equalizer to your liking. Some said that they are bass heavy, but IMHO I wouldn't say that. It's there but not overtaking as some reviewers have stated. Rather quite neutral. Left to test is the noise cancelling when outside so I can't say anything about that yet - but I imagine it's like my in ear XM4 and those take away engine sound, people talking and so on. If you decide to get these I don't think you will be anything but pleased. And for US100 less than the XM5 it's just great. And these head phone cups folds which the XM5 don't... And I have a Boose that are like that and it isn't great - aren't things supposed to get better and more innovative? What I mean is: Great to not feel like being strangled when you take them off and let them rest on your neck. Now I have over ear headphones that hopefully will last as long as my old ones: 20+ years... And with the flexibiity to use bluetooth as well. These are my only over ear from now on. I hope this ""review"" is of some usefulness for you. Cheers!Read more; With cable they don't use any battery and of course the Sony headphone app with it's equalizer doesn't work then either.

Sin duda fueron una compra demasiado buena, pasé de unos Skullcandy Hesh 2 a los Extra Bass y vaya que la diferencia es muy considerable.Ahora, 3 años después decidí hacer un ""upgrade"", yo me dedico a la música, soy estudiante de la materia y me dedico al audio, la verdad es que no puedo llevarme mis audífonos de estudio fuera de casa, necesitaba unos que realmente ofrecieran buena calidad, portabilidad y facilidad de uso con mis aplicaciones. Encontré estos después de hacer un par de búsquedas en internet, los comparé con varias opciones y al final me decidí por comprarlos.En primera debo decir que he quedado impresionado por la tecnología que traen estos audífonos. Puedes personalizar el audio acorde a tu oreja, así es, a la forma de tu oreja, Sony te pide que tomes un par de fotos para que se puedan analizar y proveer mejor experiencia, nunca en mi vida había visto algo así.Desde que los abres se denota un producto bastante premium y que vale el dinero que se paga por él, ya que de hecho no es nada barato.La experiencia de abrirlo es excelente, pero es cuando bajas la aplicación que empiezas a ver lo brutal de estas máquinas. De adelanto estos audífonos ya vienen con carga máxima, o al menos así fue en mi caso, no te pide que los cargues ni nada, funcionan desde que los sacas de la caja. Son extremadamente cómodos y si eres miope como yo y usas fierros para ver, estos audífonos no te van a incomodar en ningún momento.No es que quiera advertir, sino más bien dar aviso de que por defecto los audífonos se oyen un poco flojos, el sonido está un poco saturado, y si te gusta escuchar música como el Heavy Metal o música clásica te quedas pasmado, no se oyen para nada como los Extra Bass que al salir de la caja otorgan un sonido fino y bien configurado. Estos no, pero entiendo por qué lo hacen, ya que como mencioné, la experiencia de verdad comienza cuando bajas la aplicación que tiene como mil opciones de configuración y optimización de sonido, así que prepárate para estar ahí unos 25 minutos de tu vida, que sin duda alguna por supuesto, lo valen.Una vez que has pasado las optimizaciones, toca jugar con el ecualizador, yo recomiendo configuración 400: 1 1K: 3 2.5K: 7 6.3K: 8 16K: 5 Clear Bass: +5 o +7 para escuchar Heavy Metal y música clásica, aunque si eres fan de los medios tal vez quieras mover un poco más, pero como dije, esto es libre y Sony te prevé todas las herramientas para que esto quede sabroso.Ya con todo listo, toca escuchar música, y ahí es cuando te da el golpe. Sabía que habría una diferencia entre los Extra Bass que tengo y los M4 que son estos, pero no sabía que realmente se fuera a notar tanto. Estos no son audífonos, son interfaces de audio andantes, además, Sony te regala una prueba gratis en cualquier servicio de restringe que contenga su servicio Sony Audio 3D, yo escogí Tidal, pero también puedes escoger otros 3 más, ahí aparece la opción.De verdad que escuchar música en formato de alta calidad como es el FLAC que te ofrece Tidal es algo maravilloso, inclusive después de varios años escuchando lo mismo, logré notar varios elementos musicales extras que antes ni sabía que existían en la canción, ahí es cuando te vas para atrás, es como por fin escuchar las cosas sin filtro. También recomiendo el formato ""Loss-less"" de Apple music en caso de que sean usuarios de iPhone o solo para que tengan una tercera opción. Sea cual sea el servicio que escojan, se oye increíble, pero sin duda combinado con formatos de baja compresión esto se vuelve místico.Claro que esto no es tan plano como unos audífonos de estudio, pero sin duda la experiencia se acerca bastante.En conclusión, estos audífonos realmente son un producto bastante premium, te otorgan no solo alta calidad de audio, sino una experiencia tecnológica muy innovadora, además vienen con su porta audiófonos y cables correspondientes, son muy cómodos y portables. Los recomiendo al 100% no duden en adquirirlo para nada.Read more; Review completo como consumidor y profesional dedicado al audio, si te da flojera leer, de entrada te digo que esto vale cada centavo, no lo dudes ni esperes, rompe el cochinito porque te lo estás perdiendo.Ahora si para los que dudan de Dios:Hace 3 años adquirí los MDR-XB950N1, mejor conocidos como los Sony Extra Bass.

Zero use to me know that I can't use it as proper headset; Quality: the build quality of the product is pretty good for the price,have comfortable set of earcups.The ears do get hot after long hours of use and the padding or cushioning on the top of the head/ headpiece is not that great. The overall build is quiet strong and flexible.The sound quality is not for everyone, if you are a person who loves bass,dont buy this product.This headset is not for bass lovers. It can provide a good seperation of both low and high notes, the sound clarity,treble and the rest pretty good. It also supports Aptx and AAC. Overall sound clarity is good but not for bass lovers.The box includes the headset itself, a 2.5 to 3.5mm jack, type a to type c cable, manuals and a carrying case( more like a pouch with seperate room for tje cable).Also the earcups don't fully tilt 90° and I personally wish the headsets extendable part to have a bit more length. The headset itself feels a bit heavy imo. The portability is good,since you can fold this headset, it doesn't take a lot of bag space.The ANC on this is not good at all. Microphone is good and the transparency mode(which only works during calls) is also good. You do have app support,but there is not a lot of features in the app, you can personalize your EQ and adjust the level of the transparency mode.Overall the headset is good for the price.Read more; Quality: the build quality of the product is pretty good for the price,have comfortable set of earcups.The ears do get hot after long hours of use and the padding or cushioning on the top of the head/ headpiece is not that great.

Researched  quite a bit and spoke to friends and bought it and a good festive sale. No regrets. Yes like most headphones ears pai after prolonged use. Sound quality is great. Initially had trouble with knobs. Bluetooth is effective with a range of 20’. My old laptop Bluetooth is of a lower version hence this model was incompatible buts works best with iPad. I use it with cable. Battery life is good. I use it for movies and music. I am not a gamer. Being elderly it suffices my basic requirements.

I'd say when I first got it, my head almost felt sore from it after a few hours of wearing it. I haven't felt that soreness for a long time though now, I guess it's like riding a bike with a new seat & feeling sore when you first use it but eventually becoming used to it.I use the headset for gaming on my PC & video/voice conferencing on it also for work. I also use it for pairing to my smart phone which I use mainly for listening to music, but again for phone calls at times too.They are Sennheiser, so I don't need to talk about the audio quality... Sennheiser don't make anything but top tier audio quality devices.I would and I have recommended these headsets to people before, my ex gf even wanted a pair & asked me for advice so I recommended she get this pair & she did.My cups wore on my headset after a while as well, but this is because I was using them a lot in summer and sweating & putting my sunglasses on while I was already wearing them, I think the sunglasses caused the seams to tear with the cups. It was no problem though, I ordered replacement cups & they fit on with ease. I've ordered some extra cups too for later down the line when I will eventually need new ones (all cups for all headsets wear over time)Adding the new cups was amazing, it felt like I had a brand new headset again!Read more; I've used the 4.5 BT headset for quite a while & it's a very good headset.The audio quality is great, the quality for phone calls is very good also & adds a lot of convenience for calling people while walking or multitasking, not having to hold anything in your hand.The headsets band can be a bit uncomfortable for some people..

Previously I used Sony headphones but they're entry-level headphones.  I also used headphones from other brands like Sennheiser, One Audio and JBL but all of them are entry-level headphones. This is the first time I bought high-end headphones and I trust Sony. You can't go wrong with Sony as per my experience. Coming to the headphones, I already knew that these were best. However, I researched thoroughly on YouTube and read many articles for almost 3 months before buying these. I want to get the best value for the price. These headphones are costly and I don't want to go wrong with my purchase decision.Build quality: These are made of high-quality plastic and feel lightweight and comfortable to wear for longer durations. The only thing is, that the headband is thin and hurts a little on my head after wearing it for a few hours. Just move or adjust it a little and I'm good to go for another hour.Sound quality: It's Sony, no need to brag about sound quality. Sony is known for sound clarity. Every small musical instrument is heard in great detail. I can't forget my first experience of listening to music using these headphones. I'm blown away by the details and the clarity of sound.Battery life: It is mentioned 30 hours. Seems to be true. Headphones will easily last up to two days of mixed usage.Noise cancellation (N.C.): These headphones are my first experience with noise cancellation. When NC is turned on, it is silent. Zero noise. But after a few days,  I realised that I could still hear voices from other people when they were shouting or talking loudly. It's good not to completely block all sound.Update on N.C.:I want to address one thing people who are saying that NC is not good. I think they feel like that because of the adaptive NC feature in the Sony headphones app. Due to this feature, the level of Noise cancelling is adjusted automatically according to the surroundings. I know it doesn't work 100% accurately every time. It works sort of 70 - 80 % accurately depending on the surroundings. That's why some people complain that NC is not completely silent or perfect. Some are complaining there is no option to disable the adaptive NC feature. It is available in the Sony headphones app after the latest update. We can also manually disable the adaptive NC of headphones using the app. I mentioned these details because some people may not be aware of these features available in the headphones app.Note: When NC is turned on, a sound pressure is created between ears and headphones. So there is a vacuum-like seal between ears and headphones and it blocks external sound. I'm not sure how NC works. This is the first time for me experienced noise cancellation. It was a shock and a surprise feeling when NC was on. My brother got scared due to this effect. I got used to it now. Check the Sony manual regarding the safety of NC. In the Sony Headphones Connect app, there is a safe listening setting. Please follow it and you don't need to worry about your ears getting damaged due to headphones. I have attached screenshots of the same. Please check.Final Verdict: I can say that these headphones are the best consumer headphones.

Audiophile headphones are different that's why I mentioned them as the best consumer headphones. Most people who use them will love them.; I had been an AirPods Pro user and was always of the belief that they have the best music reproduction with lossless audio from apps like Apple Music. Was seriously wanting to try the XMs when the XM4 was launched but wasn’t happy with the reviews of mic quality as I generally take calls for more than 7 hours on my work days. But when XM5s came in was tempted to try them after the reviews paying more details on the improved mic quality. I wanted to give it a try and tried the music when I was in France in a store, but the sound quality was very poor since the store let me use it only with their wired audio source and said NO to try with my phone. Back in India I tried again once in a store using my phone and Apple Music and Boy o Boy I was proved wrong!!! I was simply blown over on how the headphones were clear with the Spatial Audio even with the default EQ setting. I’m not a bass heavy person but rather love the different tones and this is a Pro quality one in that. With the ANC microphones it was even a blessing that the call trials(both with MS Teams and Phone) I did were fantastic. Decided to grab this and ordered in Amazon when it was available for around 28K net with cashback and I would say this is the best investment I had made. The dual connectivity, monstrous battery back up, ANC combined with the best mic makes it a great headphone one can ever have. The size and case as most say as negative isn’t a problem at all. The build also is good and this is a keeper. If you are not worried about the budget and need a headphone that u can use for both work(calls) and music blindly go for this.. 👍🏻Read more; I had been an AirPods Pro user and was always of the belief that they have the best music reproduction with lossless audio from apps like Apple Music.

As per all reviews these are one of the best but you need to keep your expectation realistic. You can easily hear person talking at moderate volume in same room( reduce by a bit ) or even to next room if someone it talking loud or moderately loud.But if in next room people are talking a moderately low volume you wont hear them same is for tv, at high volume you will definitly hear it.( you can play some white noise or music than you minimise other noise.)what more to consider: These cut other background noise like of ac ( almost completely ) , birds, other typical noises. It can get little uncomfortable( unnatural silence 😂) for some in begining. you also hear people because it cut other backgroud noise so much that even little things are more highlighted.for other: If you are buying these for listening music and watching movies while travel It will cut every thing while playing music or movies. Maybe these are designed for this purpose.Pass though mode: As per my opinion its great , almost natural with no delay,Battery I didnt tested extensively that how much time it can go but I feel more than sufficient  easily last for  couple of days  if using 5-6 hours a day, charging is also fast so no worries there.Biggest bummer for me. Its no surprise that there is no dolby atmos support. I think for this price it should be there, As sony 360 audio is not supported at all platforms n very less content is available. so for spatial audio doby should had been there. I had used other product with dolby it makes huge impact.Read more; 4 star rating just for bad packing from seller as there are no packing material on the box. seller slapped bill on original box. for such premium device it is disappointing.Build and design: I had used these headphones for more than week and I would say device is very comfortable for longer use ( watching movies) , quite light weight , controls are easy to use, touch response is fast with almost no delay.Audio: Well I am not used to over the ears devices so I cant compare to others but its great overall. bit bassy for my liking and little less bright u can say but it can be easily fixed by eq. so no problems there ( may be brand had tuned it for more neutral profile) .After eq tuning these are mostly excellent for songs , movies podcast etc.also audio quality depends upon you device too. as I tested it on low end mobile and high end devices, u can observe difference.noise cancellation:  I bought these for work at home , typically coding, study research papers , as people can get really vocal and for analysing complex articles you need silence.

It can get little uncomfortable( unnatural silence 😂) for some in begining. you also hear people because it cut other backgroud noise so much that even little things are more highlighted.for other: If you are buying these for listening music and watching movies while travel It will cut every thing while playing music or movies. Maybe these are designed for this purpose.Pass though mode: As per my opinion its great , almost natural with no delay,Battery I didnt tested extensively that how much time it can go but I feel more than sufficient  easily last for  couple of days  if using 5-6 hours a day, charging is also fast so no worries there.Biggest bummer for me. Its no surprise that there is no dolby atmos support. I think for this price it should be there, As sony 360 audio is not supported at all platforms n very less content is available. so for spatial audio doby should had been there. I had used other product with dolby it makes huge impact.; Just PrefectRead more; Just PrefectRead more; Just Prefect; The media could not be loaded.O headphone é premium, apresentação, acessórios, emfim o produto é top, padrão Sony, qualidade Japonesa!Cancelamento de ruído não funciona perfeitamente pra sons muito agudos, ex: tenho periquitos australianos e com o NC ativado ainda da pra escutar o piado deles, porém se vc colocar uma música de fundo ai desaparece todos os sons ao redor e vc fica isolado.Qualidade de som nas músicas é excelente, porém tenho um Astro A40 que uso no playstation e prefiro o som do Astro com a MixAmp tanto pra músicas como filmes e séries.Em relação ao conforto achei confortável, dá pra usar por bastante tempo, porém achei o espaço para orelhas muito raso, as orelhas encostam e é oq faz ter que dar umas pausas, oq por exemplo não ocorre com o Astro A40 que o espaço é bem maior, mais confortável, a orelha não encosta e daria pra ficar o dia inteiro com ele, nesse quesito também gostaria de citar o Anker Life Q30 que era o headphone que usava antes desse, acho o Anker mais confórtável, embora perca no NC e qualidade sonora.Por fim o investimento foi grande, mais nosso problema é a taxação e o real que não vale nada comparado com o dólar, espero que o headphone dure muito tempo, pois realizei a compra por conta do meu Anker Life Q30 com 1 ano e meio de uso parou de funcionar o Noise Cancel e descascou todo e abriu a parte da espuma, levando em conta que o Anker custa em medio R$ 400 e o Sony R$ 2500 espero que se reflita na durabilidade.Read more; The media could not be loaded.O headphone é premium, apresentação, acessórios, emfim o produto é top, padrão Sony, qualidade Japonesa!Cancelamento de ruído não funciona perfeitamente pra sons muito agudos, ex: tenho periquitos australianos e com o NC ativado ainda da pra escutar o piado deles, porém se vc colocar uma música de fundo ai desaparece todos os sons ao redor e vc fica isolado.Qualidade de som nas músicas é excelente, porém tenho um Astro A40 que uso no playstation e prefiro o som do Astro com a MixAmp tanto pra músicas como filmes e séries.Em relação ao conforto achei confortável, dá pra usar por bastante tempo, porém achei o espaço para orelhas muito raso, as orelhas encostam e é oq faz ter que dar umas pausas, oq por exemplo não ocorre com o Astro A40 que o espaço é bem maior, mais confortável, a orelha não encosta e daria pra ficar o dia inteiro com ele, nesse quesito também gostaria de citar o Anker Life Q30 que era o headphone que usava antes desse, acho o Anker mais confórtável, embora perca no NC e qualidade sonora.Por fim o investimento foi grande, mais nosso problema é a taxação e o real que não vale nada comparado com o dólar, espero que o headphone dure muito tempo, pois realizei a compra por conta do meu Anker Life Q30 com 1 ano e meio de uso parou de funcionar o Noise Cancel e descascou todo e abriu a parte da espuma, levando em conta que o Anker custa em medio R$ 400 e o Sony R$ 2500 espero que se reflita na durabilidade.; Venho avaliar o produto, depois de um certo tempo de uso, comprei o mesmo, para estudos,  ouvir musicas diariamente e  principalmente pelo cancelamento de ruídos.

Still have not gone through all the features, functions, and app but based just based off the sound alone I am extremely satisfied; Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Industry Leading Noise Cancelling Headphones with Auto Noise Cancelling Optimizer, Crystal Clear Hands-Free Calling, and Alexa Voice Control, BlackWell I finally felt time to upgrade my headphones. I've been using the old Boss quiet comfort 3's.  Quite dated I know. But it lasted me a very long time.  It's done well for meNow after much time passed I finally picked up this Sony xm5.My comparison is with that old headphone.  Perhaps not the best apples to apples fairness.  I don't look for studio reference flat sound with these . I look daily music listening whilst working. Something to work out with.  Something that has good enough clarity in highs and deep bass for pop music.  My high fi lilistening is done by wired headphones which is a total other category of audiophile gear.For these I need superb noise cancelling that is superior to Bose .  I need exciting lively bass tightness and crispy highs without harshness.  A good mic for conference calls.  An ambient mode to use when jogging.This Sony xm5 delivers and TLDR I can easily replace my Bose qm3 with these.1. Sound .  First thing I noticed immediately... This has ultra tight bass .  Bass is as deep as you want it. And can be set to create a super tight quick reacting bass.  Very satisfying in all musical genres.  Wayyy exceeds Bose bass performance which IMO was its weakest point .  By default thigh highs are flat and lifeless but after a super quick EQing session I got it to my preferred listening and it sounds amazing.  I'm very happy with the sound. It feels smooth and unfatiguing when I want it... And then it can be eq'd to be clinically sharp but not harsh.... Whenever you feel like it.  It is hands down a huge step above Bose.2. Noise cancelling.  TLDR?  Huge upgrade over Bose qc3.  It's dead quiet.  It is scare silent actually... Really eerie.  I love this because I turn it on and just use it as a way to work I'm office without the hum of the hvac system.3. Ambient mode.  The Sony app allows you to adjust the levels to satisfy how much exterior sound to leak into your headphones. I like this.  It also allows you to setup detection mode to allow you to swap to ambient mode automatically when you talk and have conversations.... Music stops.  After 15 seconds the ambient mode reverts back to noise reduction mode and resumes music.  Really handy.  Love it.3. Mic for conference calls.  Absolutely outstanding without premature cutting off of voice which is a common issue with these headphone mics... Bose suffered from this greatly.  This is crystal clear mic and no issues using this in professional conference calls.4.  Tap controls.. very simple straight forward. Uses a swipe or tap setup on the right ear.  The entire right side ear flat side is a drawing board .  Large surface area makes for superbly reliable gestures that make it consistent and easy to control.  Swiping up and down is volume.  Swiping fwd or back is tracks.  Double tapping pause and resumes.  Theres no way to adjust the gesture actions on the app. .nor is there a way to make the left side become gesture side in case you prefer left side .... It's ONLY right side.  To me it is not a show stopper but perhaps for others it could be. The only other buttons is the ANC button to toggle noise cancelling mode and ambient mode.  You can program double or triple clicking of the button to launch Spotify or other music apps but I only use double tap for Spotify.  The other button is on/off / pairing.  This isn't customizable.  I would have liked to see a bit more customizable actions here but it's OK... Sometimes it's better to have more simplicity.  Oh by the way you can turn OFF the tap swipe gestures entirely  case you find this to be annoying with accidental taps especially when You're wearing the headphones laying down5. Automatic modes.  Based on location , you can have your phone help detect location and automatically set your profile for you. Example if you're working , set noise cancelling ... Or if it detects jogging then setup ambient mode . Etc... handy but not something I would use.  I like to be in control.6. Comfort.  This is a really light weight product. Very comfortable. Wraps FULLY account ear.  Theres no issue with long wear time because it's so light and feels great.  The vinyl material wraps the  foam and doesn't feel sweaty .  You can replace this with other materials ( third party).  Lots out there.  I really wished there are larger Labelling of L and R to quickly visually see which side is right.  It's a tiny little R on the inside of the headphone head piece ... The BOSe had a huge R and L on the inside of the headphone ear foam so it's hidden front he outside but still stealthy.  I get that Sonys design for these headphones are minimalist stealthy look but the R and L could've been larger and still stealthy.7. This uses USBC. And charges quick and lasts a long time.  Whilst not as long as my Bose,  it's long enough for me to be reliable to last me entire day and MORE. no problem. I have no issues here.  It's fantastic.8. The Sony connect app is clean and easy to use.  It's what unlocks the Sony headphones to another level.  Much better than Bose software.  You need it for eq and various profiles .  Without it you're going to miss out.So to conclude I'm gonna give it huge 5 star rating. Rare for me.  It's a fantastic device.  Huge upgrade from my Bose qc3.  Really happy with this so far.  And what made it a great buy from me is I've found it in Amazon warehouse open box pricing.  You can't beat that .Hope this helpsRead more; Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Industry Leading Noise Cancelling Headphones with Auto Noise Cancelling Optimizer, Crystal Clear Hands-Free Calling, and Alexa Voice Control, BlackWell I finally felt time to upgrade my headphones.

But then i read reviews for this and compared it over rtings.com and finally ended up getting these.I was not expecting much from the noise cancellation or the bass I only needed a comfortable headphones for my work day to focus.Oh boy was I surprised. The ANC is perfect for me. It wont drown out everything and sharp bursts of noise will come through, but anyway so complete silence is not what I need. At 50% volume (at which these sound amazing btw), it downs out the background droning noises to like 1% and I cant even tell my coworkers are speaking even if they are just 6 feet away from me (I can still here some mumbles but I wont be able to understand the words so I don't get distracted anymore).Coming to the sound, these are my first headphones so I can only compare it to my speakers. And I am comparing apples to oranges here but in comparison to that, these are not that great, but then again those cost like 4x as much and have much more hardware so this is a stupid comparison on my end anyway.So for these I only wanted two things - clarity and bass. These speakers have excellent quality when it comes to clarity and with the eq set to bass mode well these speakers do deliver some bass but it wont blow your mind away. But then I remember how cheap these are and I'd say they are 5/5 value for money.And these fold up too unlike the Sony ones so storage is much easier.I could not find any cons yet after my 1 wee use. Might edit this review if I find any.I would just recommend you wipe down the ear pads (which are extremely comfortable btw) once a week or so, otherwise they might get damaged coz again these are pretty cheap and they would have to do cost cutting somewhere.Read more; The media could not be loaded.This is my first ever JBL product (and my first ever over the head headphones).First of all, I love Japanese products and was initially leaning towards the Sony WH-CH720N. But then i read reviews for this and compared it over rtings.com and finally ended up getting these.I was not expecting much from the noise cancellation or the bass I only needed a comfortable headphones for my work day to focus.Oh boy was I surprised. The ANC is perfect for me. It wont drown out everything and sharp bursts of noise will come through, but anyway so complete silence is not what I need. At 50% volume (at which these sound amazing btw), it downs out the background droning noises to like 1% and I cant even tell my coworkers are speaking even if they are just 6 feet away from me (I can still here some mumbles but I wont be able to understand the words so I don't get distracted anymore).Coming to the sound, these are my first headphones so I can only compare it to my speakers. And I am comparing apples to oranges here but in comparison to that, these are not that great, but then again those cost like 4x as much and have much more hardware so this is a stupid comparison on my end anyway.So for these I only wanted two things - clarity and bass. These speakers have excellent quality when it comes to clarity and with the eq set to bass mode well these speakers do deliver some bass but it wont blow your mind away.

It looks pretty good with impressive fit and finish. The buttons feel well built yet the headphone is quite light. It did not hurt my ears even after long hours of continuous use.Sound Quality: I am an audio visual production professional and I felt it sounds quite balanced (for a JBL) in the Eq off setting. Pump up the volume and it can get pretty loud. The 'super bass' eq mode really pumps up the bass. The bass response is deep with precise attacks and releases, does not sound boomy at all. I like how these headphones sound. The calling quality too is surprisingly good. It cuts most ambient noises coming into the microphone while on a phone call.ANC: Does the job Okay but there are much better ANC headphones available in the market. Compared to the Bose Quiet series, the apple airpods pro or even the Sony headphones with ANC these felt inferior. In my recent travel in an airplane, these headphones started crackling; especially while the airplane was taking off. The filtration of the aircraft engine sound kept varying throughout my three hours of flying.Ergonomics: It takes a little while to get used to the position of the buttons. I felt that the ANC on-off toggle button should have been placed on the other earpiece of the headphone and not along with the power button or the volume control/play-pause buttons. Again, takes a while to get used to this button position. The charging port is on the top side of the right earpiece. Thus, you cannot use the headphones while charging them. The wired connection option is definitely a handy option if you want to use them connected to a computer on a table. The wire is a TRRS jack and kept playing in mono when connected to a TRS only socket.Battery Backup: Very good battery backup so even with a continuous use with ANC for approx 6 hours and with about 60% volume on music and multiple phone calls, it just consumed 40% charge.Overall verdict: It's a good buy only if you have budget constraints and you're offered hefty discounts. If not then there are far better ANC headphones available in the market.Read more; I have been using various ANC headphones for years and I bought these because my Airpods Pro got spoilt and I forgot my Bose Quiet Control 30s at home while travelling.

If not then there are far better ANC headphones available in the market.; This Headphone is a bag of mixed feelings, but let me break down what is good about it and what is missing.On one hand i feel there is a lack of Bass when i am listening to pop and upbeat music, but at the same time i works well when i am watching documentaries or doing editing as it enhances the audio by boosting its treble. So if you are a music lover and loves a lot of bass, it is not for you. You can amp up your bass from the device you have paired it to, but it doesn't hit anywhere close to premium bass quality. On the other hand if you watch a lot of Content which involves dialogues and documentaries, this is the perfect headphone for you as it gives amazing speech clarity. i would say this is also an Editors and Gamers Headphone, where communication is very important and speeches takes great importance over beats and rhythms. I like that we can Swap between Ambient aware and Noise cancellation, and it's greatest pro is the Battery life. This headphone as a very good battery life, you can run it for days without even realizing that you need to charge it. i use it for work, meetings and calls, and also for editing purpose, and i am happy with my purchase, but if i was a sound editor or into Audio Compositing i think there are better options in the market at the same price.Read more; This Headphone is a bag of mixed feelings, but let me break down what is good about it and what is missing.On one hand i feel there is a lack of Bass when i am listening to pop and upbeat music, but at the same time i works well when i am watching documentaries or doing editing as it enhances the audio by boosting its treble.

What’s worse is that there’s no repair option available—almost as if the company expects you to just buy a new pair for ₹7,000. For this price, the build quality should definitely be more reliable.That said, the sound quality is good, multipoint connectivity works smoothly, and the mic is decent. The ANC is also quite refined. But all of that doesn't matter much if the product can’t last beyond a year.Read more; I've been using these headphones for about a year, and one of the hinges is already loose and about to break.

Secondly the battery life is amazing, on a single charge I use this for like 40-45 Hrs and it still doesn't stop! Sound quality is decent in these but it's not cheap at all, tho i would say the durability is below average in these, but it's totally fine for an average user. Most importantly the mic is trash, i bought one of these in 2021 which broke in 2024 so I bought it again in 2024 and in both of the models, the mics did not work and that's the only drawback of this Headphone.Read more; The best headphones in this budget, I'm 6'3 and I have a big skull and ears but these fit perfectly on my head and are very comfortable!

Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is almost fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). It is average in terms of gaming. If you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. You can buy this headphone for games like Minecraft. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.Thank you for reading. Just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.Read more; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition.

Although I am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. There is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. Which is a pity, but ah well. Can't have it all, can ya?Best bluetooth headphones at 799 for sound AND mic quality. And let's not forget comfort. Headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.Although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.Even though I have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  Even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. So if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these.

Secondly the battery life is amazing, on a single charge I use this for like 40-45 Hrs and it still doesn't stop! Sound quality is decent in these but it's not cheap at all, tho i would say the durability is below average in these, but it's totally fine for an average user. Most importantly the mic is trash, i bought one of these in 2021 which broke in 2024 so I bought it again in 2024 and in both of the models, the mics did not work and that's the only drawback of this Headphone.Read more; The best headphones in this budget, I'm 6'3 and I have a big skull and ears but these fit perfectly on my head and are very comfortable!

Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is almost fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). It is average in terms of gaming. If you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. You can buy this headphone for games like Minecraft. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.Thank you for reading. Just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.Read more; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition.

Although I am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. There is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. Which is a pity, but ah well. Can't have it all, can ya?Best bluetooth headphones at 799 for sound AND mic quality. And let's not forget comfort. Headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.Although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.Even though I have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  Even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. So if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these. But if you don't mind going for EARPHONES, then there are many better options available in terms of sound quality.Read more; Surprisingly exceeded my expectations.

The cup size is nice & large enough to cover an entire average sized ear.The only caveat so far is the shape of the overhead band, which is way too wide, especially on a bald narrow head, so they may look a bit funny, but it is an extremely small nit-picky thing in what is otherwise an exceptionally fantastic piece of audio equipment.Although it is just the first day of use, the purpose & functionality of the headphones has been a 10/10 for the sound quality, on all audio trials & tests so far.Whether you’re looking for a pair of headphones for professional audio recording/mixing/engineering work or just to plug into your home device & hear crisp, clean & balanced sound, these HD280 PROs are absolutely perfect.

Two Thumbs Up!; SOUND:I wanted something of a neutral sounding headphones.And I say that if you're more of a bass lover this might not meet your expectation butThis headphones are very good neutral sounding headphones means every frequency is well balanced.

Kucağınıza ya da koltuk el koyacak yerin yanına koyarsanız sorun kalmıyor. Koltuk arkasına uzanırken sünüyor sonra geri toparlanıyor sadece burası güzel yani kablo dağınıklığı olmuyor ama haricinde ağırlık yapıyor. Pedler dışarıdan gelen sesi en aza indiriyor, dışarıdan sadece tiz sesler yani tabak çanak dizme sesi geliyor. İnsan sesi çok az alıyor, hele müzikle falan hiç almıyor. Kafada pek hissetmiyorsunuz en azından ben fazla hissetmiyorum. Sadece sıcakta kulağı tam sardığı için terleme sonucu kulak kaşındırması oluyor kulak duvarında. Yani arada hava alsın kulaklar. Kulaklık kafa bandı tarafında demir var zaten, yani tamamen plastik değil. Kulaklığın her bölgesi farklı plastikten yapılmış, hepsini sökme vidyosunda gördüm. Kablo çıkar tak değil biraz sorun olabilir bazıları için. Kablo çıkmayan ve ağır olduğundan yıldız kaydı 2 adet.Read more; Her şey güzel ama kablosu sarmal olduğundan ağırlık yapıyor.

Kafada pek hissetmiyorsunuz en azından ben fazla hissetmiyorum. Sadece sıcakta kulağı tam sardığı için terleme sonucu kulak kaşındırması oluyor kulak duvarında. Yani arada hava alsın kulaklar.

Kablo çıkmayan ve ağır olduğundan yıldız kaydı 2 adet.; I got tired of buying cheap headphones that break easily and don't regret paying extra for these at all. I've been frustrated why so many companies try to save a few cents making such thin cords that break in a few months only to lose money replacing them on warranty. This actually has a cord built to last and it's coiled so it's flexible. The cord is a bit short though for my setup so I use a cord extension to make sure it doesn't get tugged and damaged.I'm not an audio professional but the sound quality is amazing to me and a lot more natural sounding. The bass it has feels like having a subwoofer. The frequency response is rated for 8 Hz but from my testing at typical listening volume levels it can only noticeably play tones as low as 11 Hz, which is still pretty good. It also surprisingly blocks out a lot of outside noise too, about half as much as the hearing protection I use at work.I also love that they're comfortable and so adjustable. I like to pull one side behind my ear while singing so I can hear myself and they still fit to my head perfectly.Read more; I got tired of buying cheap headphones that break easily and don't regret paying extra for these at all.

Secondly the battery life is amazing, on a single charge I use this for like 40-45 Hrs and it still doesn't stop! Sound quality is decent in these but it's not cheap at all, tho i would say the durability is below average in these, but it's totally fine for an average user. Most importantly the mic is trash, i bought one of these in 2021 which broke in 2024 so I bought it again in 2024 and in both of the models, the mics did not work and that's the only drawback of this Headphone.Read more; The best headphones in this budget, I'm 6'3 and I have a big skull and ears but these fit perfectly on my head and are very comfortable!

Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is almost fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). It is average in terms of gaming. If you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. You can buy this headphone for games like Minecraft. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.Thank you for reading. Just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.Read more; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition.

Although I am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. There is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. Which is a pity, but ah well. Can't have it all, can ya?Best bluetooth headphones at 799 for sound AND mic quality. And let's not forget comfort. Headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.Although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.Even though I have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  Even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. So if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these. But if you don't mind going for EARPHONES, then there are many better options available in terms of sound quality.Read more; Surprisingly exceeded my expectations.

The mic is good, i tested the mic on discord and calls...It's pretty well. Battery is superb as it's been two days since I they were 100% and now when am writing this review.....it's still at 90%.

Gaming is bit of controversial as some might find it good but lemme tell u one thing that the latency is always not good at this price point but these are good for any story mode games and ok ok for competitive games.Hope it helps☺️Btw I got them for 800 rs.Read more; These headphones are good for the price but there is only one major problem that is comfort...I mean that you will not be able to wear them for long sessions otherwise it's overall a banger considering it's price.

The finish is solid and stylish.Comfort: Major issue – the ear cups start hurting within 20-30 minutes. They’re tight and feel sharp around the ears, not suitable for long use.Sound Quality: Just average. Bass is weak, vocals are flat, and overall sound is not immersive. Definitely not for music lovers or gamers.Battery Backup: Good battery life, but what’s the use if you can’t wear it comfortably?Latency: Claimed 45ms low latency – works fine for casual YouTube videos, but not ideal for fast-paced gaming.Verdict:Great looks, poor comfort, and average sound.

Amazing battery backup I only need to charge it once per week and I listen to music atleast 2 hrs everyday. The sound quality is great but you may need to use equilizers to adjust the bass since this one is specially designed for high bass. My OnePlus already provides different mode of audio settings depends on the use so no trouble for me. Durability is amazing. I dropped it 2 times from 5 ft and nothing happened not even a scratch but if you sit on it , it will break for sure. It's not water proof by the way, it can resist small drops of liquids whether sweat or water but I won't recommend these for gym . And it's on ear not over ear headphones. Prolonged use can hurt back of your ears.Read more; Bought this 3 months ago, am totally impressed.

I’ve had the ATH M50x’s for YEARS now. I use them for competitive gaming. The ear pads on them haven’t worn out yet so I decided not to buy replacements for these quite yet, despite the other reviews. The sound quality on these M20x BTH are on par but not quite as good as the M50x’s, but hey, that’s to be expected. I bought these headphones not for gaming, but for entertainment. At night when my son is sleeping I pair them to my phone and connect them to my TV through the ROKU app. I drive for UPS, and use them while I’m working to listen to videos. I’ve listened to a tiny bit of music with these as well. The other reviews state that there isn’t a whole lot of bass and I can attest to that. That being said, I don’t necessarily need a lot of bass for the genres I listen to (mostly rock and classical, but a little bit of country). They meet all the criteria for what I need them for. They are very comfortable and the volume control buttons are easily accessible. The controls are designed to where you can feel which button is which. These are very high quality and very durable for the price and very easy to get used to. I haven’t used them plugged in yet but I plan to update this review once I do, so I don’t know how adequate the cord length is. I hope this review helps anyone in the market for Bluetooth headphones. I would 100% recommend these over Beats. I had a pair for a while but they just aren’t worth the price tag compared to something like these!Read more; I bought these Bluetooth headphones a week ago, and so far so good.

The 180-degree rotation ensures they stay safe from damage when not in use, unlike other headsets that can break or tilt. The soft cushions and matte finish make long online classes and study sessions comfortable. Plus, they're ideal for outdoor activities, traveling, and gym workouts – they won’t fall off like buds, which is a huge bonus. Covering the full ear, they provide a much better experience than typical on-ear headphones.The build quality is fantastic, and the customer support team is quick and responsive if you ever need assistance. The only slight drawback is the charging time, but once charged, the call quality is premium and clear, and the music is immersive. What really impressed me is the touch controls – something you rarely find in other brands at this price.

Noise partnering with Bose for sound tuning really shows in the final product. I honestly didn't expect this level of sound quality from an Indian brand in this price range, but the audio clarity and balance are top-notch. The bass feels deep without overpowering, mids are clean, and the highs are crisp. Whether you're listening to music or watching a movie, the sound feels immersive and natural.The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is another highlight — it can cut out a surprising amount of background noise. Noise claims up to 49dB of noise cancellation, and while I haven't measured it, the performance feels on par with some higher-end earbuds. Even in crowded environments, the buds block out most distractions, making them perfect for travel or work.The design is sleek and minimal, with a comfortable fit that doesn't cause ear fatigue even after hours of use. The touch controls are responsive, and I love how you can customize them through the Noise Audio App.Battery life is impressive too — I got close to the claimed 44 hours with the case, and the buds last around 8 hours on a single charge. The dual device pairing feature is super convenient, letting me switch between my laptop and phone without any hassle.Overall, the Noise Master Buds feel like a big step forward for Indian audio brands. With Bose's tuning and solid features like ANC, spatial audio, and LDHC support, they easily compete with more expensive options.Read more; The Noise Master Buds genuinely surprised me — and in the best way possible.

The battery life is also impressive.; I recently purchased the Noise Master Buds from Amazon and overall, I'm quite satisfied with the experience. The retro-inspired design is stylish and the earbuds fit comfortably, though they are slightly bulky. Sound quality is solid with 12.4mm titanium drivers delivering balanced audio across highs and mids, though treble can get a bit sharp at higher volumes. The Active Noise Cancellation (up to 49dB) works impressively well, especially in office and commuting environments. Battery life is another strong point, offering up to 50 hours with the case and a quick charge feature that’s super handy. Indoor call quality is great, but outdoor performance struggles with background noise. However, the build quality feels a bit plasticky and the case is on the larger side, which doesn’t quite match the premium price tag. Considering all this, I find the product slightly overpriced for what it offers, but still a solid choice for everyday use. I’m giving it 4 out of 5 stars.Read more; I recently purchased the Noise Master Buds from Amazon and overall, I'm quite satisfied with the experience.

Sin ser ingeniero en sonido, músico, ni audiófilo (palabrita muy popular recientemente), debo decir que sí soy un poco exigente con la música que escucho, y estos audífonos no decepcionan.Siento los agudos y los medios muy balanceados, nunca me han molestado las fluctuaciones como para tener que bajar el volumen, y los escucho bastante claros. Los bajos son otra historia. Estos sí se sienten un poco flojos, especialmente en algunos tipos de música, no los siento tan ""ricos"" como en otros audífonos ni tan profundos, pero eso para mí no es una desventaja.Al tener un sonido bastante plano me han permitido escuchar algunas sutilezas que no habría podido con audífonos de menor calidad. Por ejemplo, al escuchar dos interpretaciones diferentes de la misma pieza de guitarra puedo escuchar la diferencia entre ellas no solamente por la manera de tocar del músico, sino también por detalles como si está usando las uñas o los dedos para tocar, algo que si bien no me es importante, es interesante notar.Para géneros como rap, electrónica y metal no me encantan. Los bajos no suenan tan divertidos ni profundos y a mi parecer a los medios y agudos les falta un poco de ""ataque"" que hace muy disfrutables estos géneros en otros audífonos.Comodidad.Aquí flaquean un poco, la banda que se apoya sobre la cabeza es una tira de vinil un tanto gruesa pero muy flexible aunque sin nada de colchón, lo que los hace un poco incómodos después de varias horas de uso. Las almohadillas son grandes, rodean perfectamente mis orejas (que son bastante grandes) y no ejercen mucha presión a pesar de que uso lentes, sin embargo al ser de vinil después de alrededor de dos horas de uso causan que comience a sudar y tenga que dejar de utilizarlos por unos minutos. Cambiaría las almohadillas por unas aterciopeladas como las de los BD.Portabilidad.Como casi todos los audífonos de este estilo, no son NADA portables. Están diseñados para escuchar música en un lugar fijo, cuentan con un cable largo, son bastante voluminosos y no se doblan ni cuentan con un estuche para transportarlos. Si deseas utilizarlos en el transporte público, mientras caminas o peor, en el gimnasio o en bici, no son el producto para ti.Estética.Son negro con dorado, bastante llamativos. No me encanta la combinación de colores, de ser completamente negros me gustarían mucho más, aunque qué se le va a hacer, si comprara audífonos por estética hubiese comprado otra marca.Conclusión.No he probado mejores audífonos que me brinden el sonido (plano) y calidad que estos AKG. Me gusta como suenan, los puedo usar por periodos prolongados de tiempo sin que me lastimen y en fin, los pros sobrepasan a los contras por mucho. Si deseas adentrarte en el mundo de los audífonos ""para audiófilos"" me parece una buena entrada de bajo costo y buena calidad. Si quieres algo más ""divertido"" y no tan plano, puedes encontrar otras marcas por menores y mayores precios, en gustos se rompen géneros y no todos buscan máxima fidelidad a la hora de escuchar su música.

Cómpralos, no te vas a arrepentir, y si lo haces, no gastaste 5k< en un par de audífonos que no utilizarás.; I am a recording engineer/producer and I owned a pair of these in the 80's and literally wore the pads out to the point I had to toss 'em. Back then, we had no internet or Amazon and I was unaware if I could even get replacement pads. I always thought I would just buy another brand new pair from the pro music shop again(which is where I bought them initially) but just never did. I remember it was a sad day when I threw them out.I remember one time when one of the pads finally completely gave up the ghost and I wore them throughout an hours-long mixing session to the point my ears were losing skin and near bleeding because of rubbing on the hard plastic grill. Ouch. Yeah, I loved them THAT MUCH for mixing along with my Near-fields.Anyway, I got my new pair today, shipping was super fast and OMG... how have I lived without these for so long? They sound better, in my opinion, than my $350 pair of Sennheiser's I've grown so accustomed to for the past decade or more.There is a reason these have been, and will remain, an industry standard in studios all around the world. They have an amazing flat response yet maintain such a rich sound at this price point that you just can't beat them if you are budget-minded like me.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THESE HEADPHONES for clarity and equal separation of frequencies across the full spectrum for engineers looking for a great mixing/referencing set of open-back headphones.BTW, I HAVE used these for tracking vocals as well without problems. (Even though so many people say you should never do it) Just turn 'em down a bit and with some simple fade-in/fade-out editing wizardry any competent engineer can do on vocal tracks will make any noticeable bleed disappear if you know what you are doing in your DAW. A lazy producer will yield lazy-sounding productions. There's no need to even mention ""bleed"" if you pull up your big-boy pants and DO some simple fade-edits.These headphones are way to comfortable and sound too good to just write them off as a pair of ""never use for tracking"" headphones because of ""bleed"".It is a great day in my world today!

I am SO HAPPY with this long overdue re-purchase of this incredible product. I have missed you my old friend! Indeed I HAVE!; I picked up a pair of AKGs back in November on sale for $[...] to substitute my Paradigm Monitor speakers while I am not at home. After much scrutiny, I picked the AKG K271 MKII; while it is not the most recent model released by the company, it offers the same sound quality and more. To put it bluntly, I was extremely satisfied.To start, the most important aspect of headphones (aka cans) of this nature: sound quality. The general consensus is that AKG is very muddy in the bass while being very bright on the high end. While the stereotype may be true in some models, the headphones are fantastic at covering the entire spectrum from muddy to crisp. I will have to agree the highs are bright, but nothing that can't be fixed to your liking in an equalizer. When I first started listening to them, I experienced the ""wow, I'v never noticed that cymbal hit before"" symptom. I could (and have) lay on my bed listening to music for hours, completely enveloped in music; the downside is the drop in external perception leads to being very startled by visitors.While an impedance of 55 Ohms doesn't necessarily call for a headphone amp, I picked one up just to see the difference. The PA2V2 was recommended to me, so I emailed the gentleman over at Electric-Avenue.com and bought one. The K271 and PA2v2 pair nicely with each other: boosting the bass and bringing out the sound as a whole, without the amp I had most audio outputs turned very high up. The amp has also been nice to have for all my headphones, but more to come on that in the PA2v2 full review.The build of the headphones is solid and I don't feel like I'm going to break them. I quite enjoy the features that have been integrated into these headphones, from them turning off when you take them off, to a small slit allowing for easy earpad replacement. To begin, the auto adjusting headband: size fitting to everyone, the band being pushed up also enables the sound to come through the drivers. The K271 also comes with a detachable cable, so you can have the long studio cable, or the spiral stretch cable (and you don't have to worry about wrapping the cable around the cans). Lastly, the cans come with leatherette or velour eapads: I personally use the velour as they warm the bass and are very comfortable.After reading through hundreds of reviews for AKG, Grado, Sennheiser, and Beyerdynamic, I cut my final choice down to the AKG K271 and K272. The difference? A whole bunch of accessories, color, and price. The K272 retails at $329 on amazon, comes in black with a 1/4 inch adapter and Velour ear pads. The K271 MKII retails at $151 on amazon, comes in dark blue with a 1/4 inch adapter, Leatherette and Velour ear pads, detachable 3m cable and 5m coiled cable.After about 70 hours of listening these cans have burned in to sound even better than when I first got them, and I strongly recommend them if you're looking for this style.

I am not an audio engineer or a seasoned audiophile by any means. That word gets thrown around a lot these days. I own a pair of Airpods Pro and needed a pair of secondary headsets for the following reasons. If you only want to know what they sound like, I've written about it at the end.1. Comfort: I needed something light weight and over-ear since the Airpods can start causing discomfort to your ears if you use them over prolonged periods of time. The AKG K52's are amazing at this. You'll pretty much forget that you have them on. One thing to remember here is that if you're in a hot environment, you could sweat around where the ear pads are. Overall, my ears are thanking me for this decision.2. Lossless Audio: If you own Bluetooth earphones like the Airpods/Airpods Pro/any Bluetooth headset, you'd be aware that it doesn't support lossless audio on Apple Music. If you'd really like to take a crack at that, these are some of the cheapest headsets with 40mm drivers. Your next best options are by Audio Technica but they cost significantly more. Since I was only looking for a secondary pair, this was a good middle ground.3. Not worry about batteries: Owning bluetooth headsets can be agonising if you wanna listen for long hours. Especially since in between I'm just watching random YouTube videos. So, I decided to pick up these wired ones.How do they sound?A: Well, they sound great but this largely depends on your taste in music. They have a very neutral sound profile. If I had to point out the biggest difference between Airpod Pro's and these is 'Immersion'. These definitely don't feel as immersive as more expensive headsets but that would be unfair to expect at the price.I'm not saying they're ""good for the price"", they're just good in general. But don't expect a thumping bass or exaggerated sound profiles, it's not meant for that. I'd recommend other headsets for those. If you're into Low-fi Hip Hop, Chill mellow music, Jazz, Acoustic music etc. these are insanely good. Great for podcasts as well. But if you're someone who loves to blow the music out at full volume and enjoy some good deep bass / loud Bollywood (I do too from time to time), these aren't the headsets for it. It can be slightly uncomfortable to listen to these at 100% volume for long hours. They're best at 50% so you can relax and work while you're listening to music.Hope that's as detailed as possible for you to make your decision. :)Read more; So, here's some context before you read this...

you won't find me raving about these for ""how amazing they sound"", but they do sound very good, especially for the price. no complaints with the sound quality esp. given the price.although, a comparable alternative would be the oneodio headphones that a lot of reviewers really like and i did also consider them, but (personally) their design was too tacky and too close to an on-ear pair which only means one thing for people with big ears: pain. but yeah, none of that ""extra bass"" bs that i absolutely detest. the music sounds clear and balanced.caveat: i keep reaching for the wire to change the song constantly forgetting that this doesn't have button controls (or even a mic, but hey, can't complain too much) 😭 if you're someone who does want these extra features, check out the oneodio pair for sure.also, the noise cancellation on these is... not good, period. like ""i could hear my fan through these when i wasn't playing anything"" not good. it's not terrible, but it's just not there, really.and okay, i know there's a whole conversation about studio/monitor headphones not being compatible with regular smartphones involving a lot of technical jargon (""impedance"", ""impedance matching"", etc.), but i don't think you'd have to worry about that stuffl with these. i use these with my redmi note 10 pro to listen to spotify, google podcasts, local music and also to watch videos/movies on youtube, netflix, prime video and i haven't encountered any issues!

Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is almost fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). It is average in terms of gaming. If you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. You can buy this headphone for games like Minecraft. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.Thank you for reading.

Although I am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. There is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. Which is a pity, but ah well. Can't have it all, can ya?Best bluetooth headphones at 799 for sound AND mic quality. And let's not forget comfort. Headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.Although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.Even though I have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  Even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. So if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these.

These headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.Let's start with the build quality. Imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. They weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. Yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.Now, I'm a reasonable person. Accidents happen. So, I contacted NOISE support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. What I got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. They dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).So, here I am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. The audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. My advice? Steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. Unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.For those seeking a more constructive alternative:Do your research! Read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.Prioritize build quality. Look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.Understand the warranty terms thoroughly. Don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.Remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. Choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.Read more; I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS.

Noise partnering with Bose for sound tuning really shows in the final product. I honestly didn't expect this level of sound quality from an Indian brand in this price range, but the audio clarity and balance are top-notch. The bass feels deep without overpowering, mids are clean, and the highs are crisp. Whether you're listening to music or watching a movie, the sound feels immersive and natural.The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is another highlight — it can cut out a surprising amount of background noise. Noise claims up to 49dB of noise cancellation, and while I haven't measured it, the performance feels on par with some higher-end earbuds. Even in crowded environments, the buds block out most distractions, making them perfect for travel or work.The design is sleek and minimal, with a comfortable fit that doesn't cause ear fatigue even after hours of use. The touch controls are responsive, and I love how you can customize them through the Noise Audio App.Battery life is impressive too — I got close to the claimed 44 hours with the case, and the buds last around 8 hours on a single charge. The dual device pairing feature is super convenient, letting me switch between my laptop and phone without any hassle.Overall, the Noise Master Buds feel like a big step forward for Indian audio brands. With Bose's tuning and solid features like ANC, spatial audio, and LDHC support, they easily compete with more expensive options.Read more; The Noise Master Buds genuinely surprised me — and in the best way possible.

The battery life is also impressive.; I recently purchased the Noise Master Buds from Amazon and overall, I'm quite satisfied with the experience. The retro-inspired design is stylish and the earbuds fit comfortably, though they are slightly bulky. Sound quality is solid with 12.4mm titanium drivers delivering balanced audio across highs and mids, though treble can get a bit sharp at higher volumes. The Active Noise Cancellation (up to 49dB) works impressively well, especially in office and commuting environments. Battery life is another strong point, offering up to 50 hours with the case and a quick charge feature that’s super handy. Indoor call quality is great, but outdoor performance struggles with background noise. However, the build quality feels a bit plasticky and the case is on the larger side, which doesn’t quite match the premium price tag. Considering all this, I find the product slightly overpriced for what it offers, but still a solid choice for everyday use. I’m giving it 4 out of 5 stars.Read more; I recently purchased the Noise Master Buds from Amazon and overall, I'm quite satisfied with the experience.

These headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.Let's start with the build quality. Imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. They weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. Yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.Now, I'm a reasonable person. Accidents happen. So, I contacted NOISE support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. What I got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. They dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).So, here I am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. The audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. My advice? Steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. Unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.For those seeking a more constructive alternative:Do your research! Read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.Prioritize build quality. Look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.Understand the warranty terms thoroughly. Don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.Remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. Choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.Read more; I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS.

The product is great for gaming. Mic quality is great. Software support very useful. I found something no one said about. The buttons on the controller may not work if you connect with 3.5 mm and rgb also will not work. But thats no problem. Detacheble mic is great. Warrenty is very good. Mic on and off slider very usefull. 7.1 sorround sound, great for both gaming and music. 7.1 will also not work on 3.5 mm. Rgb is the main hero. The comfort is good with protein foam and leather. I MAINLY RECOMMEND ONE THING THAT IS (PLS BUY A C TO C OR C TO B CABLE IF YOU ARE CONNECTING MAINLY TO MOBILE PHONE. SO THAT IT WILL TURN ON THE RGB, CONTROL SUPPORT, 7.1 SURROUND SOUND)  AN ADDITIONAL C TO C CABLE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. GREAT CHOICE. MY BEST PURCHASE IN MY LIFE... GREAT VALUE FOR MONEY.

Budgetary product.Read more; Clear voice and mic working well. No issue in sound yet, only concern is the soft wires. Budgetary product.; Budget-Friendly Bass, Decent OverallThe Portronics Conch Theta wired earphones target the budget-conscious consumer looking for a decent audio experience.  While they deliver on the promise of strong bass, other aspects of their performance are more mixed.Sound Quality:The Conch Theta's defining characteristic is its bass-heavy sound signature.  If you're a fan of genres like EDM, hip-hop, or pop, the pronounced low-end will likely appeal to you.  However, this emphasis on bass can sometimes muddy the mid frequencies, making vocals and instruments sound less distinct.  The high frequencies are present but lack sparkle and detail.  Overall, the sound is energetic and fun, but not particularly balanced or refined.Comfort and Design:The Conch Theta earphones are lightweight and generally comfortable for casual listening. The in-ear design, coupled with the included ear tips in various sizes, helps to achieve a reasonably secure fit.  The cable is fairly standard and prone to some tangling, though not excessively so.  The build quality feels plasticky, as expected at this price point, but doesn't feel overly flimsy.Features:The Conch Theta includes an in-line microphone and a single multi-function button.  The microphone works adequately for phone calls, though clarity could be better. The button allows for basic control of music playback and call management, but lacks volume controls.Overall:The Portronics Conch Theta wired earphones are a decent option for those who prioritize bass-heavy sound on a tight budget.  They're suitable for casual listening, workouts, and commuting, but aren't ideal for critical listening or audiophiles.  The emphasis on bass comes at the expense of overall clarity and balance, and the feature set is basic.Pros:* Powerful bass response* Affordable price* Lightweight and reasonably comfortable* In-line microphoneCons:* Bass-heavy sound can muddy mids and highs* Limited detail and clarity* Basic feature set (no volume control)* Cable prone to tanglingFinal Verdict:The Portronics Conch Theta wired earphones deliver a fun, bass-forward listening experience for those on a budget.  However, if you're looking for balanced sound or advanced features, you'll need to look elsewhere.Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.Read more; Budget-Friendly Bass, Decent OverallThe Portronics Conch Theta wired earphones target the budget-conscious consumer looking for a decent audio experience.

This earphone has very good mids high and lows and it has a balanced sound output.Note that this earphone's cable is very thin so it is prone to damage easily so you should keep it in mind that it must be kept carefully.If I talk about the fitting, to my ears it fits well but it all depends on person to person. The main reason I took this earphone because this earphones comes with no ear clips or you can say silicon clips so it has unique semi in earphones so it is good for your ear health so I bought this earphone for that only and I didn't expected this to be so good and as for the price of ₹280 this earphones are definitely recommended and you should definitely go for it.Read more; After listening to hundreds of earphones I can definitely say this earphone is really nice and it can easily beat 600 to 800 rupees of earphones.

The sound quality is well-balanced, offering clear vocals, decent bass, and a good level of detail for casual listening.

Noise partnering with Bose for sound tuning really shows in the final product. I honestly didn't expect this level of sound quality from an Indian brand in this price range, but the audio clarity and balance are top-notch. The bass feels deep without overpowering, mids are clean, and the highs are crisp. Whether you're listening to music or watching a movie, the sound feels immersive and natural.The Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) is another highlight — it can cut out a surprising amount of background noise. Noise claims up to 49dB of noise cancellation, and while I haven't measured it, the performance feels on par with some higher-end earbuds. Even in crowded environments, the buds block out most distractions, making them perfect for travel or work.The design is sleek and minimal, with a comfortable fit that doesn't cause ear fatigue even after hours of use. The touch controls are responsive, and I love how you can customize them through the Noise Audio App.Battery life is impressive too — I got close to the claimed 44 hours with the case, and the buds last around 8 hours on a single charge. The dual device pairing feature is super convenient, letting me switch between my laptop and phone without any hassle.Overall, the Noise Master Buds feel like a big step forward for Indian audio brands. With Bose's tuning and solid features like ANC, spatial audio, and LDHC support, they easily compete with more expensive options.Read more; The Noise Master Buds genuinely surprised me — and in the best way possible.

The battery life is also impressive.; I recently purchased the Noise Master Buds from Amazon and overall, I'm quite satisfied with the experience. The retro-inspired design is stylish and the earbuds fit comfortably, though they are slightly bulky. Sound quality is solid with 12.4mm titanium drivers delivering balanced audio across highs and mids, though treble can get a bit sharp at higher volumes. The Active Noise Cancellation (up to 49dB) works impressively well, especially in office and commuting environments. Battery life is another strong point, offering up to 50 hours with the case and a quick charge feature that’s super handy. Indoor call quality is great, but outdoor performance struggles with background noise. However, the build quality feels a bit plasticky and the case is on the larger side, which doesn’t quite match the premium price tag. Considering all this, I find the product slightly overpriced for what it offers, but still a solid choice for everyday use. I’m giving it 4 out of 5 stars.Read more; I recently purchased the Noise Master Buds from Amazon and overall, I'm quite satisfied with the experience.

Secondly the battery life is amazing, on a single charge I use this for like 40-45 Hrs and it still doesn't stop! Sound quality is decent in these but it's not cheap at all, tho i would say the durability is below average in these, but it's totally fine for an average user. Most importantly the mic is trash, i bought one of these in 2021 which broke in 2024 so I bought it again in 2024 and in both of the models, the mics did not work and that's the only drawback of this Headphone.Read more; The best headphones in this budget, I'm 6'3 and I have a big skull and ears but these fit perfectly on my head and are very comfortable!

Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is almost fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). It is average in terms of gaming. If you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. You can buy this headphone for games like Minecraft. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.Thank you for reading. Just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.Read more; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition.

Although I am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. There is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. Which is a pity, but ah well. Can't have it all, can ya?Best bluetooth headphones at 799 for sound AND mic quality. And let's not forget comfort. Headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.Although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.Even though I have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  Even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. So if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these. But if you don't mind going for EARPHONES, then there are many better options available in terms of sound quality.Read more; Surprisingly exceeded my expectations.

RHA MA 390 and Sony MDR XB55AP which is available on Amazon within Rs 2000.Decide to go with Sony for a few reasons1I heard it earlier as my friend has it and I personally like little more bass as I listen to EDM and Bollywood Remix music2Mic and Build quality as my friend was using it for about a year and they sound the same.Now that did I figured out after my purchasePackaging 5/5Box maintained its shape and I checked it’s authentication from Sony Website.It came with 03 additional was tips, I used the one it came with.One carrying case which is a nice thing. the case is ok nothing to talk much a case is a case.Build 4.5/5It looked solidly build, wire quality is above average but the best as it is not Braided.Sound Overall 7.5 /10Bass- 10/10 very balanced not overpowering but it will remind you that it’s there.Treble-9/10 balanced but I ear piercing could improve when it comes to its presence. To compare it with CX180 you can feel every beat but due to extra bass, it’s not that very prominent.Low- 10/10 You can hear every beat and especially when you want to relax and enjoy your trance or EDM it's PERFECTMID- 6-10Vocals were little low and sounded sometimes muted, I use iPhone X and Apple Music which is AAC format but still in order to enjoy vocals from singers like Arijeet Singh, Celine Dion I has to increase the sound above 50 per cent.Highs-10/10Excellent each beat and vocals can be heard of you wanna keep your volume to 70 to 80 percent. 100 percent it's too overpowering.COMFORT 5/10The fit is fine but I used for continuously for 3 hours that is when I felt little pain even though I used standard Ear-tips as they felt heavy and reminded me that I was wearing something which was not the case when I use Apple earphone or RHA MA 390 U. But you will get used to it in sometime.Noise cancellation and Mic Quality10/10I couldn’t hear anything at a railway station that justifies everything and people did not even felt that I spoke to them from the mic. So is it friendsSo overall 8/10I like bass heavy music so it fine perhaps great base and sound quality.If you wanna more comfort look for Sennheiser CX-275 which just lacks base and build quality is not good like Sony.I personally like the bass of Sony due to the kind of music I listen to, but given a choice, I would prefer little less base over comfort.I use RHA MA 390 more as I don’t feel I am wearing anything and that’s what I want with little base.Sorry Sony, I am really a fanboy but this time comfort with a warm signature of  RHA MA 390 won my vote.Enjoy listening.Read more; I thought and checked a lot of reviews prior to purchasing these earphones.My final list was Sennheiser CX-275. RHA MA 390 and Sony MDR XB55AP which is available on Amazon within Rs 2000.Decide to go with Sony for a few reasons1I heard it earlier as my friend has it and I personally like little more bass as I listen to EDM and Bollywood Remix music2Mic and Build quality as my friend was using it for about a year and they sound the same.Now that did I figured out after my purchasePackaging 5/5Box maintained its shape and I checked it’s authentication from Sony Website.It came with 03 additional was tips, I used the one it came with.One carrying case which is a nice thing. the case is ok nothing to talk much a case is a case.Build 4.5/5It looked solidly build, wire quality is above average but the best as it is not Braided.Sound Overall 7.5 /10Bass- 10/10 very balanced not overpowering but it will remind you that it’s there.Treble-9/10 balanced but I ear piercing could improve when it comes to its presence.

But only one drawback of AirPod is to listen EDM or any dance song like K-Pop or other this kind of songs. So I was finding an earphone, I'm here !!First a small review of AirPods so easily you can find the MDR-XB55AP sound quality.AirPods :Sound Clarity :Highs - 9.5/10Mids - 9/10Lows - 8/10Sound Quality :Highs - 9/10Mids - 8.5/10Lows - 7.5/10Sound Loudness :Loudness Overall - 8.5/10Let's go to MDR-XB55AP for sound quality review w.r.t. AirPods 2nd gen.MDR-XB55AP :Sound Clarity :Highs - 8/10Mids - 8.5/10Lows - 9/10Sound Quality :Highs - 8/10Mids - 8/10Lows - 9.5/10Sound Loudness :Loudness Overall - 10/10As above i gave ratings based on the individual format. It's completely depends upon the users.So finally MDR-XB55AP is good earphone for particularly EDM, DJ or any kind of party songs. And most positive thjngs is the LOWs and LOUDNESS of the MDR-XB55AP is on another level. Yeah some time the LOWs clarity issues for some kind of songs but not for all songs. And LOUDNESS is just too mush ... i can't increase my volume at 100%, it always max to max 80% while my AirPods volume, sometime i feel it's very low. MDR-XB55AP 's 12mm driver just nailed it.So if you want to listen only for EDM kind of songs then go for it otherwise no need. If you are finding great clarity of sound then you should choose another one, it's not for you.Some gamers also reviewed this earphone as bad ratings. But i don't think why they chose this earphone and rate it badly. They should have knowledge about sound. Sony clearly mentioned it is only for EDM lovers. Then why so they chose. If they are true gamer then move to Hyperx or Corsair or Logitech kind of brand, they only made accessories for Gamers.Okay anyway... EDM lovers go for it and AirPods user if you particular want to listen EDM song like me then move towards it otherwise backwards  😹.Read more; Wow or Wowwww... !!Ok let's check and find.I'm an AirPod user.

These headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.Let's start with the build quality. Imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. They weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. Yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.Now, I'm a reasonable person. Accidents happen. So, I contacted NOISE support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. What I got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. They dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).So, here I am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. The audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. My advice? Steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. Unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.For those seeking a more constructive alternative:Do your research! Read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.Prioritize build quality. Look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.Understand the warranty terms thoroughly. Don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.Remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. Choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.Read more; I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS.

The sound quality is notably low, lacking the depth and bass effect I usually look for in headphones. Whether it's the richness of music or the punch of a movie soundtrack, these headphones don't deliver.Additionally, the price tag attached to these headphones seems unjustifiable given their performance. The sound is underwhelming, and when considering the competition within the same price range, these headphones fail to stand out.Another downside is the short cable for charging, which adds to the inconvenience. Having to search for the charging slot every time becomes a frustrating routine. It's a minor issue that adds up to the overall disappointment.Ultimately, I can't recommend these headphones due to their lackluster sound, absence of bass effects, and the hassle they create with their short charging cable and inconvenient charging slot placement. At their current price point, these headphones simply aren't worth the investment.Read more; I recently purchased these headphones and unfortunately, they fell short of my expectations in multiple ways.

They come in very well-designed packaging, with a sleeve in which to keep the headphones dust-free.  They fit very comfortably over the head and can be adjusted.

Most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. Check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is almost fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). It is average in terms of gaming. If you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. You can buy this headphone for games like Minecraft. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.Thank you for reading.

Although I am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. There is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. Which is a pity, but ah well. Can't have it all, can ya?Best bluetooth headphones at 799 for sound AND mic quality. And let's not forget comfort. Headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.Although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.Even though I have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  Even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. So if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these. But if you don't mind going for EARPHONES, then there are many better options available in terms of sound quality.Read more; Surprisingly exceeded my expectations.

Since this is one of my favorite areas in electronics, expect a detailed review.Before diving in, I believe in establishing benchmarks, as comparing products helps assess their performance effectively.I own at least one headphone from every category—not meant as a brag, but to highlight my passion for varied content consumption.So, why did I choose these?It was a tough choice between the Oppo Enco Buds 2 and these, with the main differences being price and some features. Ultimately, I opted for these because for just a little more, I get IP55 rating and a larger driver.That said, a larger driver doesn’t necessarily mean better sound.Previously, I was using Skullcandy Spoke, which many enthusiasts might recognize as quite muted. You have to crank the volume above 70% to catch all the details, and they’re nearly inaudible outdoors. So even if the OnePlus turns out to be a poor choice, at least I won't be stuck with earbuds that lack volume.Likes:Excellent design—sturdy and not flimsy.Good sound quality for the price.Long battery life, though not the best in class.Stem design looks nice and fits snugly.Quick switch feature is a plus.Dislikes:Missing features like a functional game mode and volume controls on the earbuds.Accidental touches when putting them on or taking them off—not a deal-breaker, but common in the industry.Concern about losing the buds during physical activities.More customization options in the app would be appreciated.Strangely, the large ear tips fit worse than the medium ones, even though I used the larger tips with my OnePlus neckband.Read more; I’m a big fan of headphones—some might even call it an obsession.

Worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. Cuz I needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.3.Comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .4.Sturdiness and Build quality.5.Looks obviously , pictures were good but I didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.Quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.Now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. NOT A SINGLE CONCERN WAS FOUNDED TO BE TRUE.1.Mic is working absolutely fine. You can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. If you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. Now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). For all other purposes its perfect.2.I received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am I switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. It has been playing non stop. Its perfect. If you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. You don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). Battery life is sufficient. I haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. Anyway , by what I've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. Firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. Very comfortable. Its definitely over the ears and Completely covers them. Even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. Also , I dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , I've seen heavier gaming headphones. Don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .4.Build quality is very nice , Sturdy and strong. The speakers are tightly held with the band and while I don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. It loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . The RGB looks so beautiful and catchy. The overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . Is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. Everything is perfect. Though I wish now that I should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... It would've looked cooler with RGB.6. With Bluetooth , its justt Awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. Though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠Ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ I Like It (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). I don't play games so I can't talk bout Latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. Now talking bout the wired mode. It Might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. The clarity is just perfect and No latency ofcourse. No need of battery in aux mode. Can keep using it even if the battery is dead. I Like this feature so much. For a student like me , its a charmer. No unnecessary breaks . And With the full sound ☠️ You won't hear even if someone's getting murderrred in the next room ☠️ Its that awesome.  Sound does leak , but its tooo loud as well. I mean , its like a freakin mini speaker on medium volume when you keep it aside and max the volume. It is crazyyyy . You can just hang it on your neck if it gets too hot n you'll still hear everything.It is honestly my very first Wireless headphones. But I have used Boat Rockerz which my friend has , And I can say without a doubt , Giving 200 more for this one is definitely worth it.The comfort , the looks , the loudness , the RGB (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). I even got 129 cashback so it had to be a steal deal for me 😁.I'm so glad I bought this as my first headphones. I was very skeptical but now that I'm using it 😍 , Its just a wonderful experience.Most negative comments I believe are one in hundred Instances or anomaly or exceptions. Most people DON'T review a product till it's defective. Only very few people review when the product it perfect.This is to help first timers like me or for anyone who want a good headphone.Don't worry bout anything , just go for it. Luck can be bad sometimes nd you might get a bad piece , just get it replaced nd voila , problems solved. Its not like 100% of manufactured products are bad ☠️. Anyway. Ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.Read more; The media could not be loaded.Before receiving the product, these were my concerns:-1. alot of reviews were bout how the mic is bad , hence I was concerned.2. Worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. Cuz I needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.3.Comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .4.Sturdiness and Build quality.5.Looks obviously , pictures were good but I didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.Quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.Now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. NOT A SINGLE CONCERN WAS FOUNDED TO BE TRUE.1.Mic is working absolutely fine. You can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. If you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. Now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). For all other purposes its perfect.2.I received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am I switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. It has been playing non stop. Its perfect. If you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours.

Ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.; Great Budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together. Great build quality. Great fit can put straight for 2 to 3 hours, after it might feel a bit discomfort, depends on person to person. Great battery, brand claims 40hr and i get too around 38 to 39hr in it which says its approved for long hours. Very good sound quality, if you are confused between two headphones in this budget and you like BASS more, then pick this one it has great bass. So everything is good, but there is one major, very big problem which is kinda aceeptable for someone and not for a lot of pepole. The problem is Sound leakage, if you listen even above 50% vol or for some songs even at 30% vol, the sound starts to get outside earphone. your experience won't get bad for urself but the outsiders could also hear it which is why its not good to use it in public. if u go on 90% volume, rather than a headphone it becomes a speaker, u won't face any problem in ears, but voice outside will come loud easily hearable. It means brand gave everything, but could not block the speakers towards the outer end meaning voice gets outside easilyRead more; Great Budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together.

I got it for a nice deal (approx. Rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). I was reviewing multiple headphones under the Rs. 5k range. My first choice was the Sony CH-520, but I did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and I didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under Rs. 5k). The other options were Boat, Zebronics (a different set), Hammer and a variety of other ones.Among them I did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. I wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. It was available at a reasonable price and the RGB lights impressed me. So I ordered them.PROS:- Sounds good! I'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. No issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. The bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- Sturdy. The headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. While laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. I have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. They are still in good shape- RGB. The lights are definitely funky. They look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- Battery. Applaudable battery without hesitation. I use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.CONS:- Mic. I've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. My peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what I just said- Huge cushions and ear muffs! The size of the muffs are simply too big. When traveling with the headphones on in buses, I like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. But this is simply not possibly with these headphones. The muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. When I try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. So I'm forced to sit rigid for a while- Terrible button placement. The power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. This makes it very hard to use the controls. I have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. It's so ridiculous that I stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- Bad USB-C connection slot. The USB-C connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other USB-C wires because it has a narrow deep opening. So my phone's USB-C charger doesn't fit in it. Only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. This means I always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackOverall decent pair. In my previous (edited now) review, I mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. After several days I realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. So, I have edited my review and updated the ratingCheers!Read more; 3.5/5I have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. I got it for a nice deal (approx.

I highly recommend!!; I'll start off with my negative points, the ears of the headphone don't rotate the ""right"" way (earcups facing in towards your torso) they face outwards, blasting your audio into the room when you take them off and lay them around your neck. This is a big negative for me, not a fan of this at all as my previous headset rotated right into my chest and meant the sound wasn't leaking atrociously.Razer synapse did not recognise this headset whatsoever and windows bluetooth connected to the device easily, the 2.4ghz dongle seems to say connected, but when it also appears to be connected via bluetooth, and there's no distinction in windows regarding the two.Edit: This has all been solved by checking razer's website and finding out they're on a fourth synapse app, facepalm. Didn't say anywhere that there was a new app in the old one, so negative points for user friendliness there, had me scratching my head and not being able to use the headset properly!My issues regarding the bluetooth connection and 2.4 simply not working were resolved by having the new ""synapse 4"" application installed.Audio quality is quite nice when properly connected and synapse'd up, if you find yourself with tape recorder quality, make sure you have the new synapse 4 installed. |Another issue and fix I've found is although razer markets the fact you can have both 2.4ghz and bluetooth connected at the same time, trying to playback media with this will cause it to pause the instant you hit play, to solve this I just disconnected the device from bluetooth, bit of a hassle but not too big of a deal.Still heavily marred by the direction of the ear cup swivelling, i mean the headset has RGB on the outside of the ear cups for crying out loud, why on EARTH would you hide those away when you put the headset around your neck? Seriously?? While blasting audio out into the room? Not a very nice touch. but in all other regards the headset is quite nice, very comfortable on my head and can't complain about the microphone, pairs very well with nvidia broadcast to eliminate your keyboard noises that WILL come throughRead more; I'll start off with my negative points, the ears of the headphone don't rotate the ""right"" way (earcups facing in towards your torso) they face outwards, blasting your audio into the room when you take them off and lay them around your neck.

These headphones are costly and I don't want to go wrong with my purchase decision.Build quality: These are made of high-quality plastic and feel lightweight and comfortable to wear for longer durations. The only thing is, that the headband is thin and hurts a little on my head after wearing it for a few hours. Just move or adjust it a little and I'm good to go for another hour.Sound quality: It's Sony, no need to brag about sound quality. Sony is known for sound clarity. Every small musical instrument is heard in great detail. I can't forget my first experience of listening to music using these headphones. I'm blown away by the details and the clarity of sound.Battery life: It is mentioned 30 hours. Seems to be true. Headphones will easily last up to two days of mixed usage.Noise cancellation (N.C.): These headphones are my first experience with noise cancellation. When NC is turned on, it is silent. Zero noise. But after a few days,  I realised that I could still hear voices from other people when they were shouting or talking loudly. It's good not to completely block all sound.Update on N.C.:I want to address one thing people who are saying that NC is not good. I think they feel like that because of the adaptive NC feature in the Sony headphones app. Due to this feature, the level of Noise cancelling is adjusted automatically according to the surroundings. I know it doesn't work 100% accurately every time. It works sort of 70 - 80 % accurately depending on the surroundings. That's why some people complain that NC is not completely silent or perfect. Some are complaining there is no option to disable the adaptive NC feature. It is available in the Sony headphones app after the latest update. We can also manually disable the adaptive NC of headphones using the app. I mentioned these details because some people may not be aware of these features available in the headphones app.Note: When NC is turned on, a sound pressure is created between ears and headphones. So there is a vacuum-like seal between ears and headphones and it blocks external sound. I'm not sure how NC works. This is the first time for me experienced noise cancellation. It was a shock and a surprise feeling when NC was on. My brother got scared due to this effect. I got used to it now. Check the Sony manual regarding the safety of NC. In the Sony Headphones Connect app, there is a safe listening setting. Please follow it and you don't need to worry about your ears getting damaged due to headphones. I have attached screenshots of the same. Please check.Final Verdict: I can say that these headphones are the best consumer headphones. Audiophile headphones are different that's why I mentioned them as the best consumer headphones. Most people who use them will love them.Read more; These are the best headphones from Sony.

Audiophile headphones are different that's why I mentioned them as the best consumer headphones. Most people who use them will love them.; I had been an AirPods Pro user and was always of the belief that they have the best music reproduction with lossless audio from apps like Apple Music. Was seriously wanting to try the XMs when the XM4 was launched but wasn’t happy with the reviews of mic quality as I generally take calls for more than 7 hours on my work days. But when XM5s came in was tempted to try them after the reviews paying more details on the improved mic quality. I wanted to give it a try and tried the music when I was in France in a store, but the sound quality was very poor since the store let me use it only with their wired audio source and said NO to try with my phone. Back in India I tried again once in a store using my phone and Apple Music and Boy o Boy I was proved wrong!!! I was simply blown over on how the headphones were clear with the Spatial Audio even with the default EQ setting. I’m not a bass heavy person but rather love the different tones and this is a Pro quality one in that. With the ANC microphones it was even a blessing that the call trials(both with MS Teams and Phone) I did were fantastic. Decided to grab this and ordered in Amazon when it was available for around 28K net with cashback and I would say this is the best investment I had made. The dual connectivity, monstrous battery back up, ANC combined with the best mic makes it a great headphone one can ever have. The size and case as most say as negative isn’t a problem at all. The build also is good and this is a keeper. If you are not worried about the budget and need a headphone that u can use for both work(calls) and music blindly go for this.. 👍🏻Read more; I had been an AirPods Pro user and was always of the belief that they have the best music reproduction with lossless audio from apps like Apple Music.

As per all reviews these are one of the best but you need to keep your expectation realistic. You can easily hear person talking at moderate volume in same room( reduce by a bit ) or even to next room if someone it talking loud or moderately loud.But if in next room people are talking a moderately low volume you wont hear them same is for tv, at high volume you will definitly hear it.( you can play some white noise or music than you minimise other noise.)what more to consider: These cut other background noise like of ac ( almost completely ) , birds, other typical noises. It can get little uncomfortable( unnatural silence 😂) for some in begining. you also hear people because it cut other backgroud noise so much that even little things are more highlighted.for other: If you are buying these for listening music and watching movies while travel It will cut every thing while playing music or movies. Maybe these are designed for this purpose.Pass though mode: As per my opinion its great , almost natural with no delay,Battery I didnt tested extensively that how much time it can go but I feel more than sufficient  easily last for  couple of days  if using 5-6 hours a day, charging is also fast so no worries there.Biggest bummer for me. Its no surprise that there is no dolby atmos support. I think for this price it should be there, As sony 360 audio is not supported at all platforms n very less content is available. so for spatial audio doby should had been there. I had used other product with dolby it makes huge impact.Read more; 4 star rating just for bad packing from seller as there are no packing material on the box. seller slapped bill on original box. for such premium device it is disappointing.Build and design: I had used these headphones for more than week and I would say device is very comfortable for longer use ( watching movies) , quite light weight , controls are easy to use, touch response is fast with almost no delay.Audio: Well I am not used to over the ears devices so I cant compare to others but its great overall. bit bassy for my liking and little less bright u can say but it can be easily fixed by eq. so no problems there ( may be brand had tuned it for more neutral profile) .After eq tuning these are mostly excellent for songs , movies podcast etc.also audio quality depends upon you device too. as I tested it on low end mobile and high end devices, u can observe difference.noise cancellation:  I bought these for work at home , typically coding, study research papers , as people can get really vocal and for analysing complex articles you need silence.

Still have not gone through all the features, functions, and app but based just based off the sound alone I am extremely satisfied; Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Industry Leading Noise Cancelling Headphones with Auto Noise Cancelling Optimizer, Crystal Clear Hands-Free Calling, and Alexa Voice Control, BlackWell I finally felt time to upgrade my headphones. I've been using the old Boss quiet comfort 3's.  Quite dated I know. But it lasted me a very long time.  It's done well for meNow after much time passed I finally picked up this Sony xm5.My comparison is with that old headphone.  Perhaps not the best apples to apples fairness.  I don't look for studio reference flat sound with these . I look daily music listening whilst working. Something to work out with.  Something that has good enough clarity in highs and deep bass for pop music.  My high fi lilistening is done by wired headphones which is a total other category of audiophile gear.For these I need superb noise cancelling that is superior to Bose .  I need exciting lively bass tightness and crispy highs without harshness.  A good mic for conference calls.  An ambient mode to use when jogging.This Sony xm5 delivers and TLDR I can easily replace my Bose qm3 with these.1. Sound .  First thing I noticed immediately... This has ultra tight bass .  Bass is as deep as you want it. And can be set to create a super tight quick reacting bass.  Very satisfying in all musical genres.  Wayyy exceeds Bose bass performance which IMO was its weakest point .  By default thigh highs are flat and lifeless but after a super quick EQing session I got it to my preferred listening and it sounds amazing.  I'm very happy with the sound. It feels smooth and unfatiguing when I want it... And then it can be eq'd to be clinically sharp but not harsh.... Whenever you feel like it.  It is hands down a huge step above Bose.2. Noise cancelling.  TLDR?  Huge upgrade over Bose qc3.  It's dead quiet.  It is scare silent actually... Really eerie.  I love this because I turn it on and just use it as a way to work I'm office without the hum of the hvac system.3. Ambient mode.  The Sony app allows you to adjust the levels to satisfy how much exterior sound to leak into your headphones. I like this.  It also allows you to setup detection mode to allow you to swap to ambient mode automatically when you talk and have conversations.... Music stops.  After 15 seconds the ambient mode reverts back to noise reduction mode and resumes music.  Really handy.  Love it.3. Mic for conference calls.  Absolutely outstanding without premature cutting off of voice which is a common issue with these headphone mics... Bose suffered from this greatly.  This is crystal clear mic and no issues using this in professional conference calls.4.  Tap controls.. very simple straight forward. Uses a swipe or tap setup on the right ear.  The entire right side ear flat side is a drawing board .  Large surface area makes for superbly reliable gestures that make it consistent and easy to control.  Swiping up and down is volume.  Swiping fwd or back is tracks.  Double tapping pause and resumes.  Theres no way to adjust the gesture actions on the app. .nor is there a way to make the left side become gesture side in case you prefer left side .... It's ONLY right side.  To me it is not a show stopper but perhaps for others it could be. The only other buttons is the ANC button to toggle noise cancelling mode and ambient mode.  You can program double or triple clicking of the button to launch Spotify or other music apps but I only use double tap for Spotify.  The other button is on/off / pairing.  This isn't customizable.  I would have liked to see a bit more customizable actions here but it's OK... Sometimes it's better to have more simplicity.  Oh by the way you can turn OFF the tap swipe gestures entirely  case you find this to be annoying with accidental taps especially when You're wearing the headphones laying down5. Automatic modes.  Based on location , you can have your phone help detect location and automatically set your profile for you. Example if you're working , set noise cancelling ... Or if it detects jogging then setup ambient mode . Etc... handy but not something I would use.  I like to be in control.6. Comfort.  This is a really light weight product. Very comfortable. Wraps FULLY account ear.  Theres no issue with long wear time because it's so light and feels great.  The vinyl material wraps the  foam and doesn't feel sweaty .  You can replace this with other materials ( third party).  Lots out there.  I really wished there are larger Labelling of L and R to quickly visually see which side is right.  It's a tiny little R on the inside of the headphone head piece ... The BOSe had a huge R and L on the inside of the headphone ear foam so it's hidden front he outside but still stealthy.  I get that Sonys design for these headphones are minimalist stealthy look but the R and L could've been larger and still stealthy.7. This uses USBC. And charges quick and lasts a long time.  Whilst not as long as my Bose,  it's long enough for me to be reliable to last me entire day and MORE. no problem. I have no issues here.  It's fantastic.8. The Sony connect app is clean and easy to use.  It's what unlocks the Sony headphones to another level.  Much better than Bose software.  You need it for eq and various profiles .  Without it you're going to miss out.So to conclude I'm gonna give it huge 5 star rating. Rare for me.  It's a fantastic device.  Huge upgrade from my Bose qc3.  Really happy with this so far.  And what made it a great buy from me is I've found it in Amazon warehouse open box pricing.  You can't beat that .Hope this helpsRead more; Sony WH-1000XM5 Wireless Industry Leading Noise Cancelling Headphones with Auto Noise Cancelling Optimizer, Crystal Clear Hands-Free Calling, and Alexa Voice Control, BlackWell I finally felt time to upgrade my headphones.

I get that Sonys design for these headphones are minimalist stealthy look but the R and L could've been larger and still stealthy.7. This uses USBC. And charges quick and lasts a long time.  Whilst not as long as my Bose,  it's long enough for me to be reliable to last me entire day and MORE. no problem. I have no issues here.  It's fantastic.8. The Sony connect app is clean and easy to use.  It's what unlocks the Sony headphones to another level.  Much better than Bose software.  You need it for eq and various profiles .  Without it you're going to miss out.So to conclude I'm gonna give it huge 5 star rating. Rare for me.  It's a fantastic device.  Huge upgrade from my Bose qc3.  Really happy with this so far.  And what made it a great buy from me is I've found it in Amazon warehouse open box pricing.  You can't beat that .Hope this helps",headphones,18

Worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. Cuz I needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.3.Comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .4.Sturdiness and Build quality.5.Looks obviously , pictures were good but I didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.Quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.Now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. NOT A SINGLE CONCERN WAS FOUNDED TO BE TRUE.1.Mic is working absolutely fine. You can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. If you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. Now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). For all other purposes its perfect.2.I received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am I switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. It has been playing non stop. Its perfect. If you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. You don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). Battery life is sufficient. I haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. Anyway , by what I've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. Firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. Very comfortable. Its definitely over the ears and Completely covers them. Even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. Also , I dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , I've seen heavier gaming headphones. Don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .4.Build quality is very nice , Sturdy and strong. The speakers are tightly held with the band and while I don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. It loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . The RGB looks so beautiful and catchy. The overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . Is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. Everything is perfect. Though I wish now that I should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... It would've looked cooler with RGB.6. With Bluetooth , its justt Awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. Though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠Ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ I Like It (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). I don't play games so I can't talk bout Latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. Now talking bout the wired mode. It Might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. The clarity is just perfect and No latency ofcourse. No need of battery in aux mode. Can keep using it even if the battery is dead. I Like this feature so much. For a student like me , its a charmer. No unnecessary breaks . And With the full sound ☠️ You won't hear even if someone's getting murderrred in the next room ☠️ Its that awesome.  Sound does leak , but its tooo loud as well. I mean , its like a freakin mini speaker on medium volume when you keep it aside and max the volume. It is crazyyyy . You can just hang it on your neck if it gets too hot n you'll still hear everything.It is honestly my very first Wireless headphones. But I have used Boat Rockerz which my friend has , And I can say without a doubt , Giving 200 more for this one is definitely worth it.The comfort , the looks , the loudness , the RGB (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). I even got 129 cashback so it had to be a steal deal for me 😁.I'm so glad I bought this as my first headphones. I was very skeptical but now that I'm using it 😍 , Its just a wonderful experience.Most negative comments I believe are one in hundred Instances or anomaly or exceptions. Most people DON'T review a product till it's defective. Only very few people review when the product it perfect.This is to help first timers like me or for anyone who want a good headphone.Don't worry bout anything , just go for it.

Ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.; Great Budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together. Great build quality. Great fit can put straight for 2 to 3 hours, after it might feel a bit discomfort, depends on person to person. Great battery, brand claims 40hr and i get too around 38 to 39hr in it which says its approved for long hours. Very good sound quality, if you are confused between two headphones in this budget and you like BASS more, then pick this one it has great bass. So everything is good, but there is one major, very big problem which is kinda aceeptable for someone and not for a lot of pepole. The problem is Sound leakage, if you listen even above 50% vol or for some songs even at 30% vol, the sound starts to get outside earphone. your experience won't get bad for urself but the outsiders could also hear it which is why its not good to use it in public. if u go on 90% volume, rather than a headphone it becomes a speaker, u won't face any problem in ears, but voice outside will come loud easily hearable. It means brand gave everything, but could not block the speakers towards the outer end meaning voice gets outside easilyRead more; Great Budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together.

I got it for a nice deal (approx. Rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). I was reviewing multiple headphones under the Rs. 5k range. My first choice was the Sony CH-520, but I did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and I didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under Rs. 5k). The other options were Boat, Zebronics (a different set), Hammer and a variety of other ones.Among them I did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. I wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. It was available at a reasonable price and the RGB lights impressed me. So I ordered them.PROS:- Sounds good! I'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. No issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. The bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- Sturdy. The headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. While laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. I have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. They are still in good shape- RGB. The lights are definitely funky. They look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- Battery. Applaudable battery without hesitation. I use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.CONS:- Mic. I've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. My peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what I just said- Huge cushions and ear muffs! The size of the muffs are simply too big. When traveling with the headphones on in buses, I like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. But this is simply not possibly with these headphones. The muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. When I try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. So I'm forced to sit rigid for a while- Terrible button placement. The power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. This makes it very hard to use the controls. I have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. It's so ridiculous that I stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- Bad USB-C connection slot. The USB-C connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other USB-C wires because it has a narrow deep opening. So my phone's USB-C charger doesn't fit in it. Only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. This means I always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackOverall decent pair. In my previous (edited now) review, I mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. After several days I realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses.

These headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.Let's start with the build quality. Imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. They weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. Yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.Now, I'm a reasonable person. Accidents happen. So, I contacted NOISE support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. What I got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. They dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).So, here I am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. The audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. My advice? Steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. Unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.For those seeking a more constructive alternative:Do your research! Read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.Prioritize build quality. Look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.Understand the warranty terms thoroughly. Don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.Remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. Choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.Read more; I'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment I experienced with the NOISE TWO WIRLESS.

Other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. But the durability of this product is very bad. It is almost fully made of plastic. So if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. The major problem I faced using these headphones is the quality of the AUX cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). It is average in terms of gaming. If you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. You can buy this headphone for games like Minecraft. For music, this headphone is fantastic. No choice other than this at this price range.Thank you for reading. Just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.Read more; Hello Guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition.

Although I am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. There is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. Which is a pity, but ah well. Can't have it all, can ya?Best bluetooth headphones at 799 for sound AND mic quality. And let's not forget comfort. Headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.Although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.Even though I have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  Even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. So if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these. But if you don't mind going for EARPHONES, then there are many better options available in terms of sound quality.Read more; Surprisingly exceeded my expectations.

The mic is good, i tested the mic on discord and calls...It's pretty well. Battery is superb as it's been two days since I they were 100% and now when am writing this review.....it's still at 90%. Sound Quality is good. Gaming is bit of controversial as some might find it good but lemme tell u one thing that the latency is always not good at this price point but these are good for any story mode games and ok ok for competitive games.Hope it helps☺️Btw I got them for 800 rs.Read more; These headphones are good for the price but there is only one major problem that is comfort...I mean that you will not be able to wear them for long sessions otherwise it's overall a banger considering it's price.

Here’s why:🎵 Sound Quality - Crystal Clear & Balanced• The clarity is insane! I thought my Sony ZX310AP had great sound, but the EarPods bring out even more detail in vocals and instruments.• The bass is actually really good—not overpowering, but deep enough to feel the beats in pop, hip-hop, and EDM songs.• Listening to lossless music on Apple Music makes a huge difference! I finally feel like I’m hearing every layer of the song as intended.🎤 Mic Quality - Best for Calls & Gaming• The mic is so natural-sounding! My friends say my voice is clearer than most wireless earbuds.• Perfect for BGMI & voice chats—background noise is minimal, and it doesn’t over-process the voice like AI mics do.🎧 Comfort & Fit - No Pressure, Just Right!• Super comfortable for all-day use! Unlike in-ear buds that cause ear fatigue or itchiness, these just sit perfectly without going deep.• No need to constantly adjust them or deal with silicone tips getting loose.🔇 No Sound Leakage & Good Volume• I was surprised that they don’t leak sound much even at higher volumes!• Loud enough even at safe 75dB levels, and they don’t distort at max volume.🔌 No Battery Worries - Just Plug & Play!• No need to charge them, so perfect for long listening sessions without interruptions.Final VerdictIf you want clear, balanced sound, strong bass, a great mic, and ultimate comfort, the Apple EarPods are unbeatable for the price! Perfect for lossless music, gaming, and long calls.
