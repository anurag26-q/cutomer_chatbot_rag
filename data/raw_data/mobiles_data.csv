With moderate usage on WiFi, can easily last upto 2 days. Also, there is very less battery drain when idle, especially overnight. Definitely one of the best with 6000 mAh. One of my primary reasons to buy this phone.- Camera quality at this price is way above average.- Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point.- One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations.- No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer.- Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.Cons:- Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g.- Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated.- Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage.- There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates.- Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram. Ultra wide camera, 50MB camera with Sony sensor and OIS. Super Amoled display and 6000 MaH battery. UI is also good. Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.Read more; I have searched lot of phones in this price range, no one giving you all in one phone. Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram.

By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center.

But it's not for these Gen z kids, UI and software is simple and clean. Not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.Phone is heating as common as other phones.Battery life average for 5000mahValue for money; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time.

The device turned out to be defective, and the experience that followed was nothing short of frustrating.The Initial ProblemUpon receiving the device, I noticed that it had significant issues, including voice breakdown during calls. I promptly contacted Amazon's customer support, expecting a seamless replacement or refund process. However, to my surprise, they refused to replace the device, suggesting that I contact Realme's support team instead.The RunaroundI reached out to Realme's support team, hoping that they would be more helpful. Unfortunately, the issue persisted, and I was told that the problem was not resolved. The voice breakdown during calls continued, rendering the device unusable.The Replacement and Refund Period*As per Amazon's policy, I was within the 7-day replacement and refund period. However, both Amazon and Realme seemed unwilling to take responsibility for the defective device. Realme's service center refused to provide a denial letter, which Amazon required for a refund.A Catch-22 SituationThis created a Catch-22 situation, where Amazon insisted that I needed a denial letter from Realme to process a refund, while Realme's service center refused to provide such a letter. I was left feeling frustrated and helpless, with no clear resolution in sight.A Call for Better Customer Support*As a customer, I expect a certain level of service from the companies I purchase from. In this case, both Amazon and Realme fell short of my expectations. I hope that they will take steps to improve their customer support and address the issues that I faced.*Rating*- Amazon: 1/5- Realme: 1/5*Recommendation*To anyone considering purchasing the Realme Narzo 61 or dealing with similar issues with these companies, I would advise exercising caution and being prepared for potential frustrations. It's essential to research and understand the customer support policies of both the manufacturer and the retailer before making a purchase.Read more; A Frustrating Experience with Realme and AmazonI recently purchased the Realme Narzo 61 from Amazon, but my excitement was short-lived.

It had slowed down because of less RAM for higher memory programs like ola and uber which require maps  so wanted to get newer model  while keeping the company same so UI would work the same way. The exchange price was good and hence total cost came down for new modelThe new phone itself is good looking and not  heavy. With the 6 GB ram and new processor it works very fast. Multiple programs can be open and they work fine. Touch is smooth and responsive. All the regular programs we use in daily life work pretty well . No heating observed and voice is clear.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of why this phone is an excellent choice:Design and Build Quality: The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite boasts a sleek, modern design with a premium feel. The materials used are top-notch, giving it a solid and durable build. Its slim profile and lightweight nature make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.Display: The phone features a stunning AMOLED display with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. Whether watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, the visuals are crisp and clear. The high refresh rate adds to the smoothness of the experience, making every interaction buttery smooth.Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite handles everything with ease. From multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. While the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.Camera: The camera setup is impressive, especially the 50MP main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. The wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. The video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. However, low-light photography could use some improvement.Battery Life: Battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use. The 5,500mAh battery ensures you won’t run out of juice during the day. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver, allowing you to quickly top up the battery when needed.Additional Features: The phone has an official IP54 certification for protection against water splashes and dust. The design, inspired by minimalist tones and patterns, gives it a premium look. The 3.5mm audio jack is a bonus for wired earphone users.In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is an excellent smartphone in its price segment. Its design, display, performance, and battery life make it a worthy contender. While it could benefit from a newer processor and improved low-light camera performance, it still offers great value for money. For daily usage, the Nord CE 4 Lite will not disappoint.Read more; I recently purchased the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite, and it has truly exceeded my expectations, deserving a solid 5-star rating.

But it's not for these Gen z kids, UI and software is simple and clean. Not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.Phone is heating as common as other phones.Battery life average for 5000mahValue for money; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time.

Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.; Phone look like a beast nice look nice cameras nicely batteryRead more; Phone look like a beast nice look nice cameras nicely battery; Product is ok but delivery is very poor struggled to get the delivery the item in amazon.

So far experience of using GT 6T has been good, not very great but good enough.Display of phone is very good feels better than my M51 which also have AMOLED, sound is very good, haptic feedback is good not like OnePlus but just upto the mark.Camera is ok. More or less similar to M51 there are multiple features but not used any of them till now.Issues I observed1. I was Not able to take calls when it is connected to car via bluetooth or Android auto, though it shows that sound is playing via car Audio but there was not sound, inhad to change something settings in USB debugging and it is working fine now.2. I was playing music via Amazon music and then started YouTube, YouTube video started but phone was still playing music from Amazon music instead of YouTube.This got fixed on its own.Phone never hanged, never falled off my hands so not sure about durability, i have not applied any screen guard since it has victus glass. m51 had just gorrila glass and it survived multiple falls in last 4 year hoping same for this phone.Battery backup is good for my usage, M51 had 7000 mah battery this one had 5500 but charging speed is very good. Even if it can hold 80 % battery capacity by next year i would be happy since it takes just 30 mins to charge to 100% by supplied charger.I will update this thread with time. This was my feedback of using this phone in last two weeks.Update 10-oct-2024I observed that phone does not ring some times and i directly get miss call notification, observed it 3 times in 20 days.

Adding some context before diving into my experience. I was an S22 Ultra user and ditched the same for OnePlus 12 SD8G3. I wanted an add on phone for office use and for gaming (BGMI & MKX). Got this one post going through round of comparisons against IQOOs out there. Not I just had one sim in the phone as I was using it. So coming straight to how I rate this phone. It is a 5/5 for me.Looks: 4/5 ✌️✌️✌️✌️Display: 5/5 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩Touch Response: 5/5 🧈🧈🧈🧈🧈Performance: 5/5 ✨✨✨✨✨Gaming performance: 5/5 👍👍👍👍👍Speaker Output: 5/5 ( very decent)Battery: 10/5 ( Simply marvellous)Charging speed: 15/5 (no comments)Camera: 4/5 (boosted this up from 3 to 4 based off overall happiness with the phone and considering the price factor)OS: 4/5 (-1 because of few preloaded apps)Finger print scanner: 5/5So what I loved: Display and performance crisp and buttery smooth. OS is clean too to the most. SD7+G3 takes on any tasks thrown on it with ease. No hassles in multitasking. Got July security patch as of yesterday so all good on that front too. Now speaking about what I'm in love with - Being an S22 Ultra user I must say the biggest pain point has been battery since day 1. Max gaming time 3.5 Hrs. in the initial days which reduced to 1.5 over a span of 2 years. Stand-by was crazy bad too on S22 Ultra. This Lil gizmo GT 6T is a dream in this case. 3 days of game play BGMI 5 Hrs. each day and was left with 22% of juice still remaining each time. And post sleep of 6 hrs. the phone still retained 17% of charge. This already is insane in my perspective.Now coming to the charging aspect, this is unimaginable. Lightning fast... 17% - 100% in 22 minutes. Speechless in this front. Sammy used to take like 1 hr and 10 mins. in the initial days and post an year and half I really don't know. Gaming done without gtmode. Frame rate was set to auto adaptive. BGMI played in Smooth Extreme+. Brightness at ~45%. No throttling or heating. It got slightly warm at a point (really no where close to be called as heating) and then cooled too which is 😍😍😍.WhatsApp, FB, Insta, Gmail, O365, Teams and all other apps on the background. So you can go for this one blindfolded if you are looking for a phone with great backup and performance (gaming performance). I hope this is helpful.What I didn't like: Given all of above a 3.5 mm slot was expected. And sound output in headphones could have been better. I used Sony WH1000XM3 for gaming and Wf1000XM4 for listening to music and watching movie to test the output. Again you can hear all the footsteps and minute details and same applies to music if not all details but covers 90% of it but somewhere lacks the loudness factor by a bit and no Dolby Atmos so less to mention there.Lastly, I didn't cover anything on cam perspective because I was really not looking at this phone from that aspect and me sharing my experience on that front will definitely make no sense as the comparison will be against S22 Ultra here and this reaches no where close to it which is completely fine given it is not even 1/4th of the price for which I had bought S22 Ultra. That said both front and rear cam are decent is all I can say from price point perspective.Overall this is a bang on deal from my perspective and would definitely recommend going for it if you are not cam centric and looking for a great performer!Read more; This is post 3 days of using of phone and simply couldn't resist myself from writing this review.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging.

The claim that the camera quality is 50 megapixels is FAR from the truth. To test it, I compared it with Realme C12, a 7-year-old 13-megapixel phone. Except for the color grading of the pixel, nothing really has changed! There is NO benefit of any resolution here. It is pretty clear that the 50-megapixel reported camera value by the company doesn't correspond to the actual hardware.2. The battery and charging are the BIGGEST downside of the phone! The claim that the battery has around 5000+ mAh doesn't seem to be true. It is FAR inferior to my Realme C12 which reports 6000+ mAh battery. Charging doesn't work when the phone is switched on with a portable hotspot, data and GPS are on! So once switched off, the charging works well corresponding to a fast charger up to 90% of the battery charge status, after which it slows down and gets severely struck at 95% charging status. The last 5% take more than 15-20 mins!3. Sound Quality is pretty normal and ordinary compared to any other phone.4. The phone actually weighs more and is not as portable as my old 7.5k Realme C12. The camera design is pretty lame and has no performance benefit over Realme C12 in comparison. The circular extension at the back actually makes it difficult to hold a bit. The cameras are far more ordinary with just better color grading.5. It doesn't support Airtel 5G as Manufacturers admit.6. The memory capacity RAM is 4G, which is 1G improvement over Realme C12. But for an ordinary user with 4-5 years of use, this shouldn't affect him much, unless gaming or other performance extensive use.Read more; 1.

With moderate usage on WiFi, can easily last upto 2 days. Also, there is very less battery drain when idle, especially overnight. Definitely one of the best with 6000 mAh. One of my primary reasons to buy this phone.- Camera quality at this price is way above average.- Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point.- One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations.- No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer.- Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.Cons:- Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g.- Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated.- Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage.- There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates.- Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram. Ultra wide camera, 50MB camera with Sony sensor and OIS. Super Amoled display and 6000 MaH battery. UI is also good. Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box?

Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center.

While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.Update after 2+ weeks of usage:1.

While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.Read more; First impressions:1. While it has a LCD display.

The AMOLED display is sharp and smooth, with an excellent refresh rate that enhances the user experience.Battery life is reliable, easily lasting a full day, and the fast charging is incredibly efficient—100% in around 25 minutes. The design feels premium and modern, and the camera system performs very well in good lighting conditions.However, the one downside is the Funtouch OS. It's functional but lacks the polish and refinement of Origin OS, which would’ve taken the experience to the next level. If iQOO brings Origin OS globally, it could truly set a new benchmark in this segment.Still, if you’re looking for performance, fast charging, and great hardware at a competitive price, the Neo 10 R is a fantastic choice.; Good phone all in all. Especially from the performance aspect, the snapdragon 8s gen3 performs like a flagship beast giving stable 120 fps in COD mobile, bgmi and other demanding games. The phone sometimes heats up while charging or when 120 fps is unlocked but it isn't that big of deal, like it doesn't overheat and given the fps it provides the little heating is justified. The cameras are better than expected and the battery life is phenomenal, easily lasts 1.5-2 days on moderate usage. The display and haptics are top notch too. Just funtouch os needs some refinement which I hope will be solved with future updates. Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍Read more; Good phone all in all.

Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi. And about CODM,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. Crazy good phone for CODM. For FC Mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. The lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. For codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed B in coastal S&D and 4 players were camping there. In FC Mobile no drops straight up 60. Crazy performance. The cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. So if you want natural photo than it's not good. Display is Crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. One more thing that is annoying is the UI, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. Good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy. Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.Read more; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi.

Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions. In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer.Read more; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions.

Here’s a closer look at its key aspects:Design and Display:The Aqua Flow variant looks sleek with its gradient finish, adding a touch of elegance. The phone is lightweight and comfortable to hold, making it easy for one-handed use. Its 6.58-inch Full HD+ display is sharp and vibrant, offering good color reproduction and brightness for media consumption. Though not AMOLED, the display performs well in outdoor lighting conditions and provides smooth scrolling with a 120Hz refresh rate.Performance:Powered by the Dimensity 6300 5G chipset, this device ensures a snappy and fluid user experience.

Battery optimization is good, ensuring you won’t run out of juice during regular day-to-day tasks.Storage and Software:With 128GB of storage, there’s ample room for apps, media, and files, and the phone supports microSD expansion if needed.

While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.Update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.Read more; First impressions:1. While it has a LCD display.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of why this phone is an excellent choice:Design and Build Quality: The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite boasts a sleek, modern design with a premium feel. The materials used are top-notch, giving it a solid and durable build. Its slim profile and lightweight nature make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.Display: The phone features a stunning AMOLED display with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. Whether watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, the visuals are crisp and clear. The high refresh rate adds to the smoothness of the experience, making every interaction buttery smooth.Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite handles everything with ease. From multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. While the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.Camera: The camera setup is impressive, especially the 50MP main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. The wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. The video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. However, low-light photography could use some improvement.Battery Life: Battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use. The 5,500mAh battery ensures you won’t run out of juice during the day. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver, allowing you to quickly top up the battery when needed.Additional Features: The phone has an official IP54 certification for protection against water splashes and dust. The design, inspired by minimalist tones and patterns, gives it a premium look. The 3.5mm audio jack is a bonus for wired earphone users.In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is an excellent smartphone in its price segment. Its design, display, performance, and battery life make it a worthy contender. While it could benefit from a newer processor and improved low-light camera performance, it still offers great value for money. For daily usage, the Nord CE 4 Lite will not disappoint.Read more; I recently purchased the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite, and it has truly exceeded my expectations, deserving a solid 5-star rating.

This phone is absolutely not good; the battery starts discharging on its own, even without use. The phone hangs frequently, and its speed is extremely slow, just like a basic phone.

The seller does not provide any resolutions; instead of a replacement, they appoint a technician who contacts you after the warranty period is over. Then, without a physical visit, they take all the details from you and upload them online on the service portal, marking the service as completed without actually providing any service.Their service technicians have no idea how to do their job; they start talking rudely and abusively right away. This brand is absolutely not trustworthy. Anyone who buys their product will have to go through the same experience.After rescheduling the service multiple times, a technician named Vivek Yadav was appointed. His behavior was completely inappropriate; he spoke in a threatening and abusive manner and said, ""Do whatever you want, I will not provide the service visit.""Very bad and worthless experience from Amazon and their Service provider (TROUBLE SHOOTING SERVICES).Please never ever trust product and service provider like this.

Anyone who buys their product will have to go through the same experience.After rescheduling the service multiple times, a technician named Vivek Yadav was appointed. His behavior was completely inappropriate; he spoke in a threatening and abusive manner and said, ""Do whatever you want, I will not provide the service visit.""Very bad and worthless experience from Amazon and their Service provider (TROUBLE SHOOTING SERVICES).Please never ever trust product and service provider like this.

I was literally feeling harassed with these problems during past six months. A 5G phone with a 5G sim, a 5G plan & mobile tower hardly a 50 meters away from my location, It was like a useless decision to buy poco X6! Battery also drained fast due to buffering & searching the network. Swiped the sims with another 5G phones also to get the accurate solution which got positively correct. The ringtone volume also goes zero automatically & I was not able to hear the ringtone only to see several missed calls! Hence I decided to go for Moto edge 50 fusion.. BELIEVE ME friends, all my problems & complaints got solved. Writing this review after 60 days of experience. Also, Moto's build quality is excellent, 144Hz curved glass display, vegan leather back finish, weight, minimal blotware, user friendly interface, camera with Sony lenses, future sequrity updates makes this phone- the best flagship brand in this segment. One more thing I want to mention here is that, the phone & its charging accessories have a soothing fragrance which gives you a fresh feel. Vegan leather back finish is just awesome. It gives you a non slippery handling no matter its in your hand or on the dashboard of your car. I didn't find any lags during past two months of use with the snapdragon processor. Speed, accuracy and functionality is great if compared with poco X6, redmi, vivo or any other similar samsung galaxy phones. Totally peace of mind purchase I must say. Thanks Motorola for such a beautiful experience & thanks Amazon for the best deal.👍Read more; I was facing issues with network, disturbance in calling & internet speed in my poco X6 5G smartphone since day one!

But it's not for these Gen z kids, UI and software is simple and clean. Not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.Phone is heating as common as other phones.Battery life average for 5000mahValue for money; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time.

The claim that the camera quality is 50 megapixels is FAR from the truth. To test it, I compared it with Realme C12, a 7-year-old 13-megapixel phone. Except for the color grading of the pixel, nothing really has changed! There is NO benefit of any resolution here. It is pretty clear that the 50-megapixel reported camera value by the company doesn't correspond to the actual hardware.2. The battery and charging are the BIGGEST downside of the phone! The claim that the battery has around 5000+ mAh doesn't seem to be true. It is FAR inferior to my Realme C12 which reports 6000+ mAh battery. Charging doesn't work when the phone is switched on with a portable hotspot, data and GPS are on! So once switched off, the charging works well corresponding to a fast charger up to 90% of the battery charge status, after which it slows down and gets severely struck at 95% charging status. The last 5% take more than 15-20 mins!3. Sound Quality is pretty normal and ordinary compared to any other phone.4. The phone actually weighs more and is not as portable as my old 7.5k Realme C12. The camera design is pretty lame and has no performance benefit over Realme C12 in comparison. The circular extension at the back actually makes it difficult to hold a bit. The cameras are far more ordinary with just better color grading.5. It doesn't support Airtel 5G as Manufacturers admit.6. The memory capacity RAM is 4G, which is 1G improvement over Realme C12. But for an ordinary user with 4-5 years of use, this shouldn't affect him much, unless gaming or other performance extensive use.Read more; 1.

Charging doesn't work when the phone is switched on with a portable hotspot, data and GPS are on! So once switched off, the charging works well corresponding to a fast charger up to 90% of the battery charge status, after which it slows down and gets severely struck at 95% charging status. The last 5% take more than 15-20 mins!3. Sound Quality is pretty normal and ordinary compared to any other phone.4. The phone actually weighs more and is not as portable as my old 7.5k Realme C12. The camera design is pretty lame and has no performance benefit over Realme C12 in comparison. The circular extension at the back actually makes it difficult to hold a bit. The cameras are far more ordinary with just better color grading.5. It doesn't support Airtel 5G as Manufacturers admit.6. The memory capacity RAM is 4G, which is 1G improvement over Realme C12. But for an ordinary user with 4-5 years of use, this shouldn't affect him much, unless gaming or other performance extensive use.; Excellent Product!

The device turned out to be defective, and the experience that followed was nothing short of frustrating.The Initial ProblemUpon receiving the device, I noticed that it had significant issues, including voice breakdown during calls. I promptly contacted Amazon's customer support, expecting a seamless replacement or refund process. However, to my surprise, they refused to replace the device, suggesting that I contact Realme's support team instead.The RunaroundI reached out to Realme's support team, hoping that they would be more helpful. Unfortunately, the issue persisted, and I was told that the problem was not resolved. The voice breakdown during calls continued, rendering the device unusable.The Replacement and Refund Period*As per Amazon's policy, I was within the 7-day replacement and refund period. However, both Amazon and Realme seemed unwilling to take responsibility for the defective device. Realme's service center refused to provide a denial letter, which Amazon required for a refund.A Catch-22 SituationThis created a Catch-22 situation, where Amazon insisted that I needed a denial letter from Realme to process a refund, while Realme's service center refused to provide such a letter. I was left feeling frustrated and helpless, with no clear resolution in sight.A Call for Better Customer Support*As a customer, I expect a certain level of service from the companies I purchase from. In this case, both Amazon and Realme fell short of my expectations. I hope that they will take steps to improve their customer support and address the issues that I faced.*Rating*- Amazon: 1/5- Realme: 1/5*Recommendation*To anyone considering purchasing the Realme Narzo 61 or dealing with similar issues with these companies, I would advise exercising caution and being prepared for potential frustrations.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center.

With moderate usage on WiFi, can easily last upto 2 days. Also, there is very less battery drain when idle, especially overnight. Definitely one of the best with 6000 mAh. One of my primary reasons to buy this phone.- Camera quality at this price is way above average.- Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point.- One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations.- No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer.- Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.Cons:- Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g.- Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated.- Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage.- There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates.- Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Especially from the performance aspect, the snapdragon 8s gen3 performs like a flagship beast giving stable 120 fps in COD mobile, bgmi and other demanding games. The phone sometimes heats up while charging or when 120 fps is unlocked but it isn't that big of deal, like it doesn't overheat and given the fps it provides the little heating is justified. The cameras are better than expected and the battery life is phenomenal, easily lasts 1.5-2 days on moderate usage. The display and haptics are top notch too. Just funtouch os needs some refinement which I hope will be solved with future updates. Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍Read more; Good phone all in all.

And about CODM,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. Crazy good phone for CODM. For FC Mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. The lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. For codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed B in coastal S&D and 4 players were camping there. In FC Mobile no drops straight up 60. Crazy performance. The cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. So if you want natural photo than it's not good. Display is Crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. One more thing that is annoying is the UI, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. Good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy. Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.Read more; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi.

Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions. In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer.Read more; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions.

While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.Update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.Read more; First impressions:1. While it has a LCD display.

The claim that the camera quality is 50 megapixels is FAR from the truth. To test it, I compared it with Realme C12, a 7-year-old 13-megapixel phone. Except for the color grading of the pixel, nothing really has changed! There is NO benefit of any resolution here. It is pretty clear that the 50-megapixel reported camera value by the company doesn't correspond to the actual hardware.2. The battery and charging are the BIGGEST downside of the phone! The claim that the battery has around 5000+ mAh doesn't seem to be true. It is FAR inferior to my Realme C12 which reports 6000+ mAh battery. Charging doesn't work when the phone is switched on with a portable hotspot, data and GPS are on! So once switched off, the charging works well corresponding to a fast charger up to 90% of the battery charge status, after which it slows down and gets severely struck at 95% charging status. The last 5% take more than 15-20 mins!3. Sound Quality is pretty normal and ordinary compared to any other phone.4. The phone actually weighs more and is not as portable as my old 7.5k Realme C12. The camera design is pretty lame and has no performance benefit over Realme C12 in comparison. The circular extension at the back actually makes it difficult to hold a bit. The cameras are far more ordinary with just better color grading.5. It doesn't support Airtel 5G as Manufacturers admit.6. The memory capacity RAM is 4G, which is 1G improvement over Realme C12. But for an ordinary user with 4-5 years of use, this shouldn't affect him much, unless gaming or other performance extensive use.Read more; 1.

Highly recommended!; I recently purchased the OnePlus 13R, and I must say, it’s an absolute powerhouse for its price! The phone delivers flagship-level performance, a buttery smooth display, and impressive battery life. Here are my key takeaways:✅ Performance: The phone is blazing fast, handling everything from gaming to multitasking with ease. The chipset is well-optimized, ensuring lag-free performance.✅ Display: The 120Hz AMOLED screen is vibrant and smooth. Watching content on this phone is a pleasure!✅ Battery & Charging: The battery easily lasts a day, and the fast charging is a game changer—it goes from 0 to 100% in minutes!✅ Camera: The camera performs well in good lighting, with sharp details and accurate colors. Low-light photography is decent but could use some improvements.However, my experience was soured by an unfair exchange practice by the delivery agent. When I opted to exchange my old phone, which was in perfect working condition, the delivery agent deliberately found unnecessary faults (Saying that the display has some discoloration, which was not the case) to lowball the exchange value.

Make sure to record the condition of your old phone before handing it over and stand your ground if the delivery agent tries to devalue it unfairly.Would have given 5 stars if not for the exchange scam!Read more; I recently purchased the OnePlus 13R, and I must say, it’s an absolute powerhouse for its price! The phone delivers flagship-level performance, a buttery smooth display, and impressive battery life. Here are my key takeaways:✅ Performance: The phone is blazing fast, handling everything from gaming to multitasking with ease. The chipset is well-optimized, ensuring lag-free performance.✅ Display: The 120Hz AMOLED screen is vibrant and smooth. Watching content on this phone is a pleasure!✅ Battery & Charging: The battery easily lasts a day, and the fast charging is a game changer—it goes from 0 to 100% in minutes!✅ Camera: The camera performs well in good lighting, with sharp details and accurate colors. Low-light photography is decent but could use some improvements.However, my experience was soured by an unfair exchange practice by the delivery agent. When I opted to exchange my old phone, which was in perfect working condition, the delivery agent deliberately found unnecessary faults (Saying that the display has some discoloration, which was not the case) to lowball the exchange value.

Right out of the box, the packaging felt premium – classic OnePlus style with the bold red theme and neatly arranged accessories.First Impressions:The setup was quick, and the phone felt super snappy from the start. The touch responsiveness is excellent – something my mom instantly noticed and appreciated. The display is vibrant, bright even in outdoor lighting, and the in-display fingerprint sensor works smoothly and reliably.Camera:One of the standout features is the telephoto camera. For the price, the detail and clarity in zoomed shots are genuinely impressive. My mom enjoys taking close-up photos of plants and family, and she’s already started experimenting with portrait and macro modes.Battery Life & Performance:The battery life has been great – it easily lasts a full day with moderate to heavy use. And thanks to OnePlus’ fast charging, the phone tops up really quickly. The overall performance is buttery smooth with no noticeable lags, thanks to the Snapdragon chipset and optimized OxygenOS.Why It Worked for My Mom:• Clean and easy-to-use interface• Lightweight and comfortable in hand• Loud and clear speaker output for calls and videos• Very responsive fingerprint and face unlockShe’s already loving it, and I’ll be happy to share a longer-term update after 30 days of usage. So far, it feels like a solid choice and a worthy gift.Read more; I recently purchased the OnePlus 13R as a gift for my mom ahead of Mother’s Day, and it’s been a delightful experience so far.

Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna.

The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g.

As I was literally waiting for this phone to be released. I've already used tecno phantom fold first version.. I was so impressed with that phone that even though it's display went dead suddenly after 1 year of purchase, I still decided to buy this fold 2 considering how good fold 1 was.. That was my big mistake.. Since the day of purchase, I.e ,20th Dec 2024,the hinge seemed somewhat tight... Unlike fold 1 which was so easy to open.. I thought may be because it's a new one.. It's tighter.. And I hardly unfolded the phone these past few days as I was very busy with my work.. Yesterday I was trying to unfold it as wanted to use 2 screens.. It was tighter.. I gave a but more pressure and suddenly heard a Crack sound and flickering of display of mainscreen.. I was immediately reminded of the sudden dead screen of my first tecno fold one.. That one lasted atleast 1 Yr.. This one hardly lasted 15 days.. I tool it to nearby carlcare Centre.. That guy was saying you should have escalated this hinge problem immediately before the screen broke.i don't know if I can do anything now. Or you have to pay 56000 rs for main screen replacement.Imagine the pain when a device which you bought with so much anticipation at a price of 80k.. Again costing 56k for repair..Hope the tecno team will sort this out without me spending huge money from my pocket. If I have to pay 56k for it.. I would rather keep it aside and buy some other phone..Amazon has accepted to take the product back and issue refund.. I have returned the product but after few days Amazon was denting refund saying that wrong item was sent.. When I've contacted them, they told me product received was same but their is mismatch in some serial number..when I have asked them to show proof they are not showing. And moreover they are refusing to return the product back. The pickup boy has confirmed everything during pick up.. Worst customer service by Amazon.. They are not issuing refund and also not returning the phone back.. Pathetic service from Amazon. I have bought atleast 15 mobiles from Amazon and shop atleast 15k to 20k every month from Amazon.. Yet their customer service is worst..Read more; I never though I would give 1 star to this phone.. As I was literally waiting for this phone to be released.

Battery: The massive 5750mAh battery is a game-changer! I easily get a full day of use, even with heavy multitasking and media consumption.3. Display: The large, vibrant display is perfect for watching videos and multitasking. It’s a joy to use in unfolded mode.4. Camera: The triple 50MP camera setup delivers excellent photos, especially in good lighting. OIS helps stabilize videos, which is great for content creation.5. Performance: The 12GB RAM ensures smooth performance, and 512GB of storage is more than enough for apps,  photos and filesRead more; I recently purchased the TECNO Phantom V Fold 2 in Rippling Blue, and I must say, it's an impressive device that delivers on most of its promises.

When I attempted to open it, the screen was already damaged. Upon consulting the service agent, I was informed that such problems are quite common with this model, and the screen replacement would cost  of 48,000 rupees. Also, the agent showed me another phone with a similar issue as mine.Given these experiences, I would not recommend buying flip or fold phones, as they seem to be prone to issues and require costly maintenance.Read more; Don't Buy....After just four months, the internal screen broke even though I hadn't unfolded the phone for several days.

The device turned out to be defective, and the experience that followed was nothing short of frustrating.The Initial ProblemUpon receiving the device, I noticed that it had significant issues, including voice breakdown during calls. I promptly contacted Amazon's customer support, expecting a seamless replacement or refund process. However, to my surprise, they refused to replace the device, suggesting that I contact Realme's support team instead.The RunaroundI reached out to Realme's support team, hoping that they would be more helpful. Unfortunately, the issue persisted, and I was told that the problem was not resolved. The voice breakdown during calls continued, rendering the device unusable.The Replacement and Refund Period*As per Amazon's policy, I was within the 7-day replacement and refund period. However, both Amazon and Realme seemed unwilling to take responsibility for the defective device. Realme's service center refused to provide a denial letter, which Amazon required for a refund.A Catch-22 SituationThis created a Catch-22 situation, where Amazon insisted that I needed a denial letter from Realme to process a refund, while Realme's service center refused to provide such a letter. I was left feeling frustrated and helpless, with no clear resolution in sight.A Call for Better Customer Support*As a customer, I expect a certain level of service from the companies I purchase from. In this case, both Amazon and Realme fell short of my expectations. I hope that they will take steps to improve their customer support and address the issues that I faced.*Rating*- Amazon: 1/5- Realme: 1/5*Recommendation*To anyone considering purchasing the Realme Narzo 61 or dealing with similar issues with these companies, I would advise exercising caution and being prepared for potential frustrations. It's essential to research and understand the customer support policies of both the manufacturer and the retailer before making a purchase.Read more; A Frustrating Experience with Realme and AmazonI recently purchased the Realme Narzo 61 from Amazon, but my excitement was short-lived.

Especially from the performance aspect, the snapdragon 8s gen3 performs like a flagship beast giving stable 120 fps in COD mobile, bgmi and other demanding games. The phone sometimes heats up while charging or when 120 fps is unlocked but it isn't that big of deal, like it doesn't overheat and given the fps it provides the little heating is justified. The cameras are better than expected and the battery life is phenomenal, easily lasts 1.5-2 days on moderate usage. The display and haptics are top notch too. Just funtouch os needs some refinement which I hope will be solved with future updates. Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍Read more; Good phone all in all.

Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi. And about CODM,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. Crazy good phone for CODM. For FC Mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. The lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. For codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed B in coastal S&D and 4 players were camping there. In FC Mobile no drops straight up 60. Crazy performance. The cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. So if you want natural photo than it's not good. Display is Crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. One more thing that is annoying is the UI, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. Good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy.

Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions. In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer.Read more; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions.

So far experience of using GT 6T has been good, not very great but good enough.Display of phone is very good feels better than my M51 which also have AMOLED, sound is very good, haptic feedback is good not like OnePlus but just upto the mark.Camera is ok. More or less similar to M51 there are multiple features but not used any of them till now.Issues I observed1. I was Not able to take calls when it is connected to car via bluetooth or Android auto, though it shows that sound is playing via car Audio but there was not sound, inhad to change something settings in USB debugging and it is working fine now.2. I was playing music via Amazon music and then started YouTube, YouTube video started but phone was still playing music from Amazon music instead of YouTube.This got fixed on its own.Phone never hanged, never falled off my hands so not sure about durability, i have not applied any screen guard since it has victus glass. m51 had just gorrila glass and it survived multiple falls in last 4 year hoping same for this phone.Battery backup is good for my usage, M51 had 7000 mah battery this one had 5500 but charging speed is very good. Even if it can hold 80 % battery capacity by next year i would be happy since it takes just 30 mins to charge to 100% by supplied charger.I will update this thread with time.

This was my feedback of using this phone in last two weeks.Update 10-oct-2024I observed that phone does not ring some times and i directly get miss call notification, observed it 3 times in 20 days. No other issue till date.; This is post 3 days of using of phone and simply couldn't resist myself from writing this review. Got the Razor Green 12 GB 512 GB for 32K post Bank discount. Adding some context before diving into my experience. I was an S22 Ultra user and ditched the same for OnePlus 12 SD8G3. I wanted an add on phone for office use and for gaming (BGMI & MKX). Got this one post going through round of comparisons against IQOOs out there. Not I just had one sim in the phone as I was using it. So coming straight to how I rate this phone. It is a 5/5 for me.Looks: 4/5 ✌️✌️✌️✌️Display: 5/5 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩Touch Response: 5/5 🧈🧈🧈🧈🧈Performance: 5/5 ✨✨✨✨✨Gaming performance: 5/5 👍👍👍👍👍Speaker Output: 5/5 ( very decent)Battery: 10/5 ( Simply marvellous)Charging speed: 15/5 (no comments)Camera: 4/5 (boosted this up from 3 to 4 based off overall happiness with the phone and considering the price factor)OS: 4/5 (-1 because of few preloaded apps)Finger print scanner: 5/5So what I loved: Display and performance crisp and buttery smooth. OS is clean too to the most. SD7+G3 takes on any tasks thrown on it with ease. No hassles in multitasking. Got July security patch as of yesterday so all good on that front too. Now speaking about what I'm in love with - Being an S22 Ultra user I must say the biggest pain point has been battery since day 1. Max gaming time 3.5 Hrs. in the initial days which reduced to 1.5 over a span of 2 years. Stand-by was crazy bad too on S22 Ultra. This Lil gizmo GT 6T is a dream in this case. 3 days of game play BGMI 5 Hrs. each day and was left with 22% of juice still remaining each time. And post sleep of 6 hrs. the phone still retained 17% of charge. This already is insane in my perspective.Now coming to the charging aspect, this is unimaginable. Lightning fast... 17% - 100% in 22 minutes. Speechless in this front. Sammy used to take like 1 hr and 10 mins. in the initial days and post an year and half I really don't know. Gaming done without gtmode. Frame rate was set to auto adaptive. BGMI played in Smooth Extreme+. Brightness at ~45%. No throttling or heating. It got slightly warm at a point (really no where close to be called as heating) and then cooled too which is 😍😍😍.WhatsApp, FB, Insta, Gmail, O365, Teams and all other apps on the background. So you can go for this one blindfolded if you are looking for a phone with great backup and performance (gaming performance). I hope this is helpful.What I didn't like: Given all of above a 3.5 mm slot was expected. And sound output in headphones could have been better. I used Sony WH1000XM3 for gaming and Wf1000XM4 for listening to music and watching movie to test the output. Again you can hear all the footsteps and minute details and same applies to music if not all details but covers 90% of it but somewhere lacks the loudness factor by a bit and no Dolby Atmos so less to mention there.Lastly, I didn't cover anything on cam perspective because I was really not looking at this phone from that aspect and me sharing my experience on that front will definitely make no sense as the comparison will be against S22 Ultra here and this reaches no where close to it which is completely fine given it is not even 1/4th of the price for which I had bought S22 Ultra. That said both front and rear cam are decent is all I can say from price point perspective.Overall this is a bang on deal from my perspective and would definitely recommend going for it if you are not cam centric and looking for a great performer!Read more; This is post 3 days of using of phone and simply couldn't resist myself from writing this review.

But it's not for these Gen z kids, UI and software is simple and clean. Not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.Phone is heating as common as other phones.Battery life average for 5000mahValue for money; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time.

The phone has a decent (rather large) display screen, responsive finger print sensor, and overall decent performance. It looks surprisingly premium for its price. With her moderate use, the battery lasts more than a day. Camera seems average, but that's expected at this price point. The only down side is the MI UI OS which comes preloaded with a lot of bloatware and unnecessary apps. Fortunately, you can remove/disable most apps. For a price of 7.5k, I find it a good budget phone especially for basic daily use.Read more; I bought this phone for my mother who uses her phone for basic tasks (calling, messaging, maps, AI apps) and social media use cases (WhatsApp, YouTube etc).

While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.Update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. A capable set of speakers.

I don't play games.- Worst front facing camera I used. And I have always used budget phones.+ Back camera is average. Didn't use it much though.- I do miss stereo speakers during video calls or music playing. (I also have Realme P1 as a primary)+ Battery is also average. Not great not worst.- No charger. Seriously. And charge time is just insanely high for a 5000mah Battery.+ OneUI is great.- Bloatware install during setup and hidden settings is not great.- Only 3 fingerprints can be added. More would have been nice.- UFS 2.2 storage is slow and not at all worth it. App installation is going to take more time than downloading it.Suggestions :> Use light theme throughout the day.> Disable unwanted apps.> If you use it yourself or give this to your parents or any one, please disable glance and disable any bloatware you don't want.> F16 was launched a bit cheaper than this one.

But it's not for these Gen z kids, UI and software is simple and clean. Not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.Phone is heating as common as other phones.Battery life average for 5000mahValue for money; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of why this phone is an excellent choice:Design and Build Quality: The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite boasts a sleek, modern design with a premium feel. The materials used are top-notch, giving it a solid and durable build. Its slim profile and lightweight nature make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.Display: The phone features a stunning AMOLED display with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. Whether watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, the visuals are crisp and clear. The high refresh rate adds to the smoothness of the experience, making every interaction buttery smooth.Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite handles everything with ease. From multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. While the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.Camera: The camera setup is impressive, especially the 50MP main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. The wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. The video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. However, low-light photography could use some improvement.Battery Life: Battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use. The 5,500mAh battery ensures you won’t run out of juice during the day. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver, allowing you to quickly top up the battery when needed.Additional Features: The phone has an official IP54 certification for protection against water splashes and dust. The design, inspired by minimalist tones and patterns, gives it a premium look. The 3.5mm audio jack is a bonus for wired earphone users.In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is an excellent smartphone in its price segment. Its design, display, performance, and battery life make it a worthy contender. While it could benefit from a newer processor and improved low-light camera performance, it still offers great value for money.

With moderate usage on WiFi, can easily last upto 2 days. Also, there is very less battery drain when idle, especially overnight. Definitely one of the best with 6000 mAh. One of my primary reasons to buy this phone.- Camera quality at this price is way above average.- Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point.- One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations.- No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer.- Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.Cons:- Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g.- Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated.- Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage.- There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates.- Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram. Ultra wide camera, 50MB camera with Sony sensor and OIS. Super Amoled display and 6000 MaH battery. UI is also good.

By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center.

Especially from the performance aspect, the snapdragon 8s gen3 performs like a flagship beast giving stable 120 fps in COD mobile, bgmi and other demanding games. The phone sometimes heats up while charging or when 120 fps is unlocked but it isn't that big of deal, like it doesn't overheat and given the fps it provides the little heating is justified. The cameras are better than expected and the battery life is phenomenal, easily lasts 1.5-2 days on moderate usage. The display and haptics are top notch too. Just funtouch os needs some refinement which I hope will be solved with future updates. Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍Read more; Good phone all in all.

And about CODM,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. Crazy good phone for CODM. For FC Mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. The lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. For codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed B in coastal S&D and 4 players were camping there. In FC Mobile no drops straight up 60. Crazy performance. The cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. So if you want natural photo than it's not good. Display is Crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. One more thing that is annoying is the UI, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. Good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy.

In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer.Read more; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram. Ultra wide camera, 50MB camera with Sony sensor and OIS. Super Amoled display and 6000 MaH battery. UI is also good. Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.Read more; I have searched lot of phones in this price range, no one giving you all in one phone. Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram.

Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center.

But it's not for these Gen z kids, UI and software is simple and clean. Not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.Phone is heating as common as other phones.Battery life average for 5000mahValue for money; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time.

I was literally feeling harassed with these problems during past six months. A 5G phone with a 5G sim, a 5G plan & mobile tower hardly a 50 meters away from my location, It was like a useless decision to buy poco X6! Battery also drained fast due to buffering & searching the network. Swiped the sims with another 5G phones also to get the accurate solution which got positively correct. The ringtone volume also goes zero automatically & I was not able to hear the ringtone only to see several missed calls! Hence I decided to go for Moto edge 50 fusion.. BELIEVE ME friends, all my problems & complaints got solved. Writing this review after 60 days of experience. Also, Moto's build quality is excellent, 144Hz curved glass display, vegan leather back finish, weight, minimal blotware, user friendly interface, camera with Sony lenses, future sequrity updates makes this phone- the best flagship brand in this segment. One more thing I want to mention here is that, the phone & its charging accessories have a soothing fragrance which gives you a fresh feel. Vegan leather back finish is just awesome. It gives you a non slippery handling no matter its in your hand or on the dashboard of your car. I didn't find any lags during past two months of use with the snapdragon processor. Speed, accuracy and functionality is great if compared with poco X6, redmi, vivo or any other similar samsung galaxy phones. Totally peace of mind purchase I must say.

Even after going to sevice center of Motorola, phone issues are not resolved. And Amazon will return this phone only after getting letter from Motorola service center saying that they cannot resolve the issue. And This center is not providing any such letter. 1st time in 10 years I'm dissatisfied with Amazon & I started using the phone as it is.; Wonderful mobile phone. I like its performance.

The claim that the camera quality is 50 megapixels is FAR from the truth. To test it, I compared it with Realme C12, a 7-year-old 13-megapixel phone. Except for the color grading of the pixel, nothing really has changed! There is NO benefit of any resolution here. It is pretty clear that the 50-megapixel reported camera value by the company doesn't correspond to the actual hardware.2. The battery and charging are the BIGGEST downside of the phone! The claim that the battery has around 5000+ mAh doesn't seem to be true. It is FAR inferior to my Realme C12 which reports 6000+ mAh battery. Charging doesn't work when the phone is switched on with a portable hotspot, data and GPS are on! So once switched off, the charging works well corresponding to a fast charger up to 90% of the battery charge status, after which it slows down and gets severely struck at 95% charging status. The last 5% take more than 15-20 mins!3. Sound Quality is pretty normal and ordinary compared to any other phone.4. The phone actually weighs more and is not as portable as my old 7.5k Realme C12. The camera design is pretty lame and has no performance benefit over Realme C12 in comparison. The circular extension at the back actually makes it difficult to hold a bit. The cameras are far more ordinary with just better color grading.5. It doesn't support Airtel 5G as Manufacturers admit.6. The memory capacity RAM is 4G, which is 1G improvement over Realme C12. But for an ordinary user with 4-5 years of use, this shouldn't affect him much, unless gaming or other performance extensive use.Read more; 1.

With moderate usage on WiFi, can easily last upto 2 days. Also, there is very less battery drain when idle, especially overnight. Definitely one of the best with 6000 mAh. One of my primary reasons to buy this phone.- Camera quality at this price is way above average.- Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point.- One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations.- No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer.- Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.Cons:- Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g.- Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated.- Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage.- There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates.- Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram. Ultra wide camera, 50MB camera with Sony sensor and OIS. Super Amoled display and 6000 MaH battery. UI is also good. Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.Read more; I have searched lot of phones in this price range, no one giving you all in one phone. Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram.

Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center.

Well, the new Camera 6.0 has kept that natural look but finally maybe brought in some smart, minimal processing or maybe they improved the OIS. The result?

IP54 dust and water resistance: Added durability.3. 48-month fluency promise: realme's commitment to software updates.4. Charger included: Convenient.5. Affordable price point.Cons:1. Performance issues: Device can be slow, especially with multitasking.2. Occasional lag and freezing: Frustrating experience.3. Display touch issues: Unresponsive or inaccurate touch registration.4. Limited storage (64GB): May require frequent cleaning or expansion.Key Features:- 6.5"" HD+ display- MediaTek Helio G35 processor- 4GB RAM, 64GB storage (expandable up to 1TB)- 48MP primary camera, 2MP macro, 2MP depth sensor- 5000mAh battery- Android 12 (Realme UI 3.0)Verdict:The realme Narzo N61 has potential, but its performance and display issues hold it back. If you prioritize smooth performance and responsive touch, consider alternatives.Recommendation:Ideal for:- Basic users (calling, texting, social media)- Casual gaming (non-demanding titles)Not recommended for:- Demanding gamers- Multitaskers- Those seeking seamless performanceRating Breakdown:- Display: 3.5/5 (touch issues)- Performance: 3.0/5 (slow, laggy)- Battery: 4.0/5- Camera: 3.5/5- Value: 4.5/5Suggestions for realme:1.

The device turned out to be defective, and the experience that followed was nothing short of frustrating.The Initial ProblemUpon receiving the device, I noticed that it had significant issues, including voice breakdown during calls. I promptly contacted Amazon's customer support, expecting a seamless replacement or refund process. However, to my surprise, they refused to replace the device, suggesting that I contact Realme's support team instead.The RunaroundI reached out to Realme's support team, hoping that they would be more helpful. Unfortunately, the issue persisted, and I was told that the problem was not resolved. The voice breakdown during calls continued, rendering the device unusable.The Replacement and Refund Period*As per Amazon's policy, I was within the 7-day replacement and refund period. However, both Amazon and Realme seemed unwilling to take responsibility for the defective device. Realme's service center refused to provide a denial letter, which Amazon required for a refund.A Catch-22 SituationThis created a Catch-22 situation, where Amazon insisted that I needed a denial letter from Realme to process a refund, while Realme's service center refused to provide such a letter. I was left feeling frustrated and helpless, with no clear resolution in sight.A Call for Better Customer Support*As a customer, I expect a certain level of service from the companies I purchase from. In this case, both Amazon and Realme fell short of my expectations. I hope that they will take steps to improve their customer support and address the issues that I faced.*Rating*- Amazon: 1/5- Realme: 1/5*Recommendation*To anyone considering purchasing the Realme Narzo 61 or dealing with similar issues with these companies, I would advise exercising caution and being prepared for potential frustrations. It's essential to research and understand the customer support policies of both the manufacturer and the retailer before making a purchase.Read more; A Frustrating Experience with Realme and AmazonI recently purchased the Realme Narzo 61 from Amazon, but my excitement was short-lived.

It's user friendly.; My ratings 4.45/5⭐Okay! I'm writing this review after one month of usage. I played BGMI and FF, ran antutu test and cpu throttling too..Pros:-1) Gaming:-  No doubt that this is the best phone for gaming at this price segment, I played both FF and BGMI on this device, the dimensity 7300 processor runs so smoothly so that you can experience a lag free gaming even in high graphics/resolution. (To experience true 90FPS gaming you need to turn on the GT mode).2)Performance:- Gaming phones generally do perform well on normal usage too, same here, the processor was good enough and runs smoothly even on multitasking. (Can give a max of 120hz refresh rate). Performance wise no doubt, you will be satisfied!3)Design and display: The 6.67 inch OLED display was really good and appreciable!4)Camera:- Although primarily this was not a camera phone but still the picture quality was fine and good, with a 50mp back camera and 16mp front camera (Back camera was better though).5)Battery:- Battery backup was good, comes with a 45W supervoc UF inbox charger, Takes almost 1 hr 20 mins to charge fully from zero. Can give a full working day backup on normal usage.6) Sound quality:- Sound quality was fine, The stereo speakers are loud and clear, For calls they've included clear voice(ENC) feature too.(There was no Dolby Atmos BTW, should 've included it! :)7) Comfort in hand: Trust me, this mobile is really comfortable in hand while holding and gaming. You don't feel any slipperiness.Cons:-1) The main problem i personally experienced is 'overheating', like wtf man it goes till 42.5°C while charging and 41°C while gaming at a room temperature of 30 degrees!!2) Too much bloatware from the app market (although you can clear it).3) build quality/looks:-  The built quality can be improved, both frame and back comes with a plastic material and No Gorrila glass too:)4) Should also have included NFC tap to pay or Gorrila glass as most phone's at this price are providing any one of them.5) Antutu scores: When I ran antutu test, it scored nearly 670k (BTW they've said 750k)👎🏻. Although 670k was a good score, it was much lesser than what they've said(750k).Final verdict: This phone was mainly focused on gaming and performance, if you are a mobile gamer or need a good performance mobile, you can go for it. If you prefer good camera and build quality/design this  might not be a better choice for you!!This phone worked well for me!!

With moderate usage on WiFi, can easily last upto 2 days. Also, there is very less battery drain when idle, especially overnight. Definitely one of the best with 6000 mAh. One of my primary reasons to buy this phone.- Camera quality at this price is way above average.- Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point.- One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations.- No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer.- Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.Cons:- Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g.- Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated.- Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage.- There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates.- Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram. Ultra wide camera, 50MB camera with Sony sensor and OIS. Super Amoled display and 6000 MaH battery. UI is also good. Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.Read more; I have searched lot of phones in this price range, no one giving you all in one phone. Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram.

Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center.

Especially from the performance aspect, the snapdragon 8s gen3 performs like a flagship beast giving stable 120 fps in COD mobile, bgmi and other demanding games. The phone sometimes heats up while charging or when 120 fps is unlocked but it isn't that big of deal, like it doesn't overheat and given the fps it provides the little heating is justified. The cameras are better than expected and the battery life is phenomenal, easily lasts 1.5-2 days on moderate usage. The display and haptics are top notch too. Just funtouch os needs some refinement which I hope will be solved with future updates. Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍Read more; Good phone all in all.

Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi. And about CODM,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. Crazy good phone for CODM. For FC Mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. The lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. For codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed B in coastal S&D and 4 players were camping there. In FC Mobile no drops straight up 60. Crazy performance. The cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. So if you want natural photo than it's not good. Display is Crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. One more thing that is annoying is the UI, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. Good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy. Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.Read more; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi.

Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions. In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer.Read more; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram. Ultra wide camera, 50MB camera with Sony sensor and OIS. Super Amoled display and 6000 MaH battery. UI is also good. Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.Read more; I have searched lot of phones in this price range, no one giving you all in one phone. Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram.

Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center.

While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.Update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. A capable set of speakers.

The phone only supports 16 AI-generated photos and doesn’t offer 4K video recording. It has a 108MP rear camera, but no additional lenses, limiting its ability to take different types of photos. The front camera pictures also lose quality when zoomed in, which isn’t great.On top of that, the phone doesn’t have Gorilla Glass or any other protective screen, making it easy to scratch. Even though it has a 5000mAh battery, it doesn’t last a full day, and the 18W charging is slow, with noticeable heating issues when charging.The camera doesn’t perform well in low light, so night photography is disappointing. The phone also heats up during gaming, which affects its performance. Without Electronic Image Stabilization (EIS), videos aren’t very stable, especially when moving or shooting handheld.The 6.67-inch LCD screen, with a resolution of 1600x720 pixels (HD+), is below average, and it doesn’t look as clear as other phones in this price range. Even though TECNO claims the phone has a 120Hz refresh rate, scrolling through apps like YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook feels laggy after using it for a while.TECNO also advertises a 12-month OTTPlay subscription with a scratch code included in the box, but the code doesn’t work after just a month, which is frustrating.The phone has dual stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos, but the sound during WhatsApp video calls or on loudspeaker isn’t as loud as expected. For the price, this kind of quality just isn’t good enough.Read more; Buying the TECNO POVA 6 NEO for ₹13,999 feels like a waste, especially with the misleading claims about the AI camera.

But it's not for these Gen z kids, UI and software is simple and clean. Not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.Phone is heating as common as other phones.Battery life average for 5000mahValue for money; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability.

But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.Cons:- Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g.- Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated.- Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage.- There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates.- Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram. Ultra wide camera, 50MB camera with Sony sensor and OIS. Super Amoled display and 6000 MaH battery. UI is also good. Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.Read more; I have searched lot of phones in this price range, no one giving you all in one phone. Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram.

Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center.

Here’s a closer look at its key aspects:Design and Display:The Aqua Flow variant looks sleek with its gradient finish, adding a touch of elegance. The phone is lightweight and comfortable to hold, making it easy for one-handed use. Its 6.58-inch Full HD+ display is sharp and vibrant, offering good color reproduction and brightness for media consumption. Though not AMOLED, the display performs well in outdoor lighting conditions and provides smooth scrolling with a 120Hz refresh rate.Performance:Powered by the Dimensity 6300 5G chipset, this device ensures a snappy and fluid user experience. It handles multitasking well, although the 4GB RAM might struggle slightly with heavier apps and games when compared to 6GB or 8GB variants. For regular usage like social media, video streaming, and casual gaming, the phone performs admirably. The inclusion of 5G support is a strong future-proofing move, especially at this price point.Camera:The 50MP Sony AI Camera setup is one of the phone’s strongest features. It takes good-quality pictures in daylight with sharp details and vivid colors. However, low-light performance could be better, as images tend to get noisy in dim environments. The AI optimizations, such as scene recognition, enhance the photography experience, making it easy to capture decent shots with minimal effort. The front camera is decent for selfies and video calls, though not exceptional.Battery and Charging:The phone packs a 5000mAh battery, which easily lasts a full day of moderate use. The charger in the box is a nice touch, offering fast charging support that gets the phone charged in under two hours. Battery optimization is good, ensuring you won’t run out of juice during regular day-to-day tasks.Storage and Software:With 128GB of storage, there’s ample room for apps, media, and files, and the phone supports microSD expansion if needed.

Especially from the performance aspect, the snapdragon 8s gen3 performs like a flagship beast giving stable 120 fps in COD mobile, bgmi and other demanding games. The phone sometimes heats up while charging or when 120 fps is unlocked but it isn't that big of deal, like it doesn't overheat and given the fps it provides the little heating is justified. The cameras are better than expected and the battery life is phenomenal, easily lasts 1.5-2 days on moderate usage. The display and haptics are top notch too. Just funtouch os needs some refinement which I hope will be solved with future updates. Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍Read more; Good phone all in all.

Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi. And about CODM,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. Crazy good phone for CODM. For FC Mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. The lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. For codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed B in coastal S&D and 4 players were camping there. In FC Mobile no drops straight up 60. Crazy performance. The cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. So if you want natural photo than it's not good. Display is Crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. One more thing that is annoying is the UI, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. Good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy. Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.Read more; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi.

Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions. In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer.Read more; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions.

Not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.Phone is heating as common as other phones.Battery life average for 5000mahValue for money; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram. Ultra wide camera, 50MB camera with Sony sensor and OIS. Super Amoled display and 6000 MaH battery. UI is also good. Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.Read more; I have searched lot of phones in this price range, no one giving you all in one phone. Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram.

Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center.

But it's not for these Gen z kids, UI and software is simple and clean. Not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.Phone is heating as common as other phones.Battery life average for 5000mahValue for money; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time.

Vivo should work on better integration like Apple does with Instagram and Snapchat.Overall: Not a perfect phone, but a well-balanced one with the best camera in the market.

While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.Update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.Read more; First impressions:1. While it has a LCD display.

And about CODM,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. Crazy good phone for CODM. For FC Mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. The lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. For codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed B in coastal S&D and 4 players were camping there. In FC Mobile no drops straight up 60. Crazy performance. The cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. So if you want natural photo than it's not good. Display is Crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. One more thing that is annoying is the UI, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. Good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy.

Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions. In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer.Read more; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions.

This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer.",smartphones,9

But it's not for these Gen z kids, UI and software is simple and clean. Not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.Phone is heating as common as other phones.Battery life average for 5000mahValue for money; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time.

I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.; Phone look like a beast nice look nice cameras nicely batteryRead more; Phone look like a beast nice look nice cameras nicely battery; Product is ok but delivery is very poor struggled to get the delivery the item in amazon.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of why this phone is an excellent choice:Design and Build Quality: The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite boasts a sleek, modern design with a premium feel. The materials used are top-notch, giving it a solid and durable build. Its slim profile and lightweight nature make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.Display: The phone features a stunning AMOLED display with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. Whether watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, the visuals are crisp and clear. The high refresh rate adds to the smoothness of the experience, making every interaction buttery smooth.Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite handles everything with ease. From multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. While the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.Camera: The camera setup is impressive, especially the 50MP main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. The wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. The video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. However, low-light photography could use some improvement.Battery Life: Battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use. The 5,500mAh battery ensures you won’t run out of juice during the day. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver, allowing you to quickly top up the battery when needed.Additional Features: The phone has an official IP54 certification for protection against water splashes and dust. The design, inspired by minimalist tones and patterns, gives it a premium look. The 3.5mm audio jack is a bonus for wired earphone users.In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is an excellent smartphone in its price segment. Its design, display, performance, and battery life make it a worthy contender. While it could benefit from a newer processor and improved low-light camera performance, it still offers great value for money. For daily usage, the Nord CE 4 Lite will not disappoint.Read more; I recently purchased the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite, and it has truly exceeded my expectations, deserving a solid 5-star rating.

Metal build phone which feels premium and a notch above the rest of its competitors. Design is just pleasant to look at.2. Software after Android 15 and Oxygen os 15 update has become even more smooth and snappy which makes everyday use more refined and premium.3. With snapdragon 7+ gen 3 this phone is fast and feels like a flagship. Played games like BGMI and COD at 90 fps without any frames drop.4. Battery backup is amazing and it easily gives me 8 hrs plus SOT on day to day balanced use and 7+ hrs on a heavy use. I charge ones a day and next day I am still left with few more minutes before charging. Plus 100W superfast charger is cherry on top5. Haptics are just exceptioal and performs better than many flagship phones.6. The long software and security support also gives this phone a better chance to retain its resale value for longer period than its competitors.7. Clean software experience though it came with few bloatwares with its own app market but after deleting those apps and disabling the app market the experience has been overall great.8. This comes with flat screen which is great considering many good phone under this price segment have curve screens.Cons:-1. Camera is good but could have been better. Not a camera guy so it works for me but may not for the ones who want best camera for their buck.2. The front glass is not from the Corning thus should be handled with care and a screen tempered glass is must for this one.So in the end this is currently amongst the best balanced phone one could buy for this price and can experience a great phone at such low price.Read more; Writing this Review After 20 days use and I can say this phone doesn't disappoint.Pros :-1.

The first thing that stood out is how light it feels in the hand, the build quality is sleek and solid, almost mimicking an iPhone-level finish. It has a premium touch without the premium price.Performance-wise, it’s smooth and responsive. Apps open quickly, multitasking is a breeze, and there’s been no lag so far. The 8GB RAM with 256GB storage is more than enough for my daily use — whether it's gaming, streaming, or work. The indisplay Fingerprint sensor is so fast and soo cool.The screen size is perfect. Not too big, not too small, just right for comfortable viewing, typing, and media consumption. Colors are good, and brightness is on point, even outdoors.Obsidian Black looks stunning, clean, classy, and minimal. Overall, for the price point, the OnePlus Nord 4 is delivering way more than expected.Read more; Been using this phone for 2 days now.

Overall, for the price point, the OnePlus Nord 4 is delivering way more than expected.; I am writing this review after 1 month of using the Oneplus Nord 4. It is one of the best midrange phone that you can blindly buy without any confusion. I bought this phone during Great Indian festival after so much research and doubts. I was not sure which phone will be the best in 30000 segment. I was looking for a balanced phone which has everything like good performance, good design, good battery and good camera. I don't want to compromise in any one thing. So after lot of research i was having confusion between nord 4 and realme gt 6t. But in realme gt 6t the display is curved which i don't prefer at all. Curved display is waste of money and feels like gimmick so i avoided it and bought nord 4. Now i feel it was the best decision.Best features of this Nord 4 are-Design - I literally loved the mercurian silver metel design which looks so much premium. I thought metel might be heavier but in daily use its not a problem at all. It cools down so fast and does not have any heating issues at all.Performance - It has the best performance and able to play BGMI so smoothly. Flat screen helps so much in games also.Battery -  If you use normally the battery will last more than 1 day easily and it charges the phone within 25mins.Camera - I felt the main camera is so good and it takes very decent photos. 50mp camera performs above average. If camera is your main priority then its better to go for realme, vivo, Samsung or Iphone which are camera centric. But then other areas you have to compromise. Trust me below 30k this phone takes very good photos.Network - Being a metel phone i am getting 5g network always without any problem. Never felt any Issues at all.Display - It has best display and content viewing experience is top notch with minimum bezzels.This review is genuine and trust me if you want a balanced midrange phone you can go for Oneplus Nord 4 for sure. Greenline is coming in all the brands so no need to get back from this phone because of this reason....(If any problems comes in future then i will update the review for sure)Read more; I am writing this review after 1 month of using the Oneplus Nord 4.

Even Banking apps open and work very smoothly.2. Screen. Very vivid and bright. Didn't notice any change on refresh rate side.3. Fast Charging. 100% charge within 15-20 minutes.4. Battery Backup. Lasts 2 days with mild usage.5. Call Quality. Despite having a single mic, call quality is good.6. Camera. Though it lacked few advanced features like slow motion recording, 4K 60 fps recording, still camera quality is good. Captures very good shots in day light but looses a bit of details in low light but still good enough. 3x zoom also a good feature. Selfie camera is also satisfactory.Didn't like,1. Speaker. I was using Redmi Note7 Pro for last 6 years and was expecting similar sound quality. Its a single speaker setup and sound is not that deep like of Note7 Pro.2. Build. Its a bit bulky. If you have short hand than you will struggle to use it with a single hand.Overall good phone. Want Pro features than go for Note Pro.Read more; It's been a month using this phone.

The first thing I noticed was the weight—it feels surprisingly light despite housing a large 5500 mAh battery, which is impressive for long-lasting power without adding bulk. The phone is slim, comfortable to hold, and fits well in the hand, making it ideal for daily use.The camera quality is good for standard photos but has limitations. While it handles basic shots decently, the wide-angle video quality falls short, and there’s no 60 fps option in 4K, which could be a drawback for those who love detailed video work. Additionally, I noticed the camera app tends to lag or even get stuck after taking multiple portrait-mode shots, which disrupts the experience a bit.Overall, it's a solid budget option with good design, reasonable performance, and decent battery life, though the camera could use a few software improvements for smoother functionality.Read more; After using this phone for a month, I can say it's a great choice, especially for the price.

First I need to use it and under rigorous testing only I can put forward my verdict so that any brother or  sister can buy the same from Amazon.BODY : OnePlus has comeup with a very durable body and stylish. Looking premium.DISPLAY: Its a PureAmoled with 10Bit resolution with crispy HDR10 features. Vibrant natural color and screen ratio is 88.5% to body ratio. So very less bezels.BATTERY: Easily comes for 1 and half day if not playing any games. With games 1 day. No idle midnight auto battery drain and all. 5500mAh is very slowly discharging and due to 100w charger coming inside the box the mobile charges in 17 to 18minutes only upto 85% and full 100% charging approx 19 minutes as per my test.CAMERA: Very ok for the price. I got one update recently in May 25, 2024 and after this the camera works wonderful specially selfie and portrait mode.PROCESSOR: Snapdragon 7Gen3 name is enough that it is very stable and fast multi tasking and even this snapdragon version not heats up fastly.  The clock speed is amazingly impressive to any games like PUBG or FreeFires or Asphalt. Rest all the medium games runs smoothly. No throttle. No lag and even No uncommon heating issues etc.METWORK: Very fast 5G and even 4G also no issues. Runs smoothly without any call drop or any disturbance in voice quality. The Voice Focus mode works very nice even in the rush or crowded metro area. Last time recorded download speed was 175mbps & upload speed approx 145 to 166mbps.STEREO SPEAKERS: This is what attracted me the most. The stereo speakers are very loud enough. And even it sync the eaarpods very quickly. OnePlus earpods are recommended for all those EQ and bass.OVERALL VERDICT:  Very lightest mobile inspite of 5500 mAh battery. Too premium boxy design. Call and network speed very impressive. After investing on this phone I have not regretted. Highly recommended and Value for money. Thanks Seller and Amazon. 100w charger in the box. Backcase and screen guard all in the box. A complete midrange killer phone. Highly valuable.Read more; I usually not write ✍️ review very fast when it comes to smartphone.

It's user friendly.; My ratings 4.45/5⭐Okay! I'm writing this review after one month of usage. I played BGMI and FF, ran antutu test and cpu throttling too..Pros:-1) Gaming:-  No doubt that this is the best phone for gaming at this price segment, I played both FF and BGMI on this device, the dimensity 7300 processor runs so smoothly so that you can experience a lag free gaming even in high graphics/resolution. (To experience true 90FPS gaming you need to turn on the GT mode).2)Performance:- Gaming phones generally do perform well on normal usage too, same here, the processor was good enough and runs smoothly even on multitasking. (Can give a max of 120hz refresh rate). Performance wise no doubt, you will be satisfied!3)Design and display: The 6.67 inch OLED display was really good and appreciable!4)Camera:- Although primarily this was not a camera phone but still the picture quality was fine and good, with a 50mp back camera and 16mp front camera (Back camera was better though).5)Battery:- Battery backup was good, comes with a 45W supervoc UF inbox charger, Takes almost 1 hr 20 mins to charge fully from zero. Can give a full working day backup on normal usage.6) Sound quality:- Sound quality was fine, The stereo speakers are loud and clear, For calls they've included clear voice(ENC) feature too.(There was no Dolby Atmos BTW, should 've included it! :)7) Comfort in hand: Trust me, this mobile is really comfortable in hand while holding and gaming. You don't feel any slipperiness.Cons:-1) The main problem i personally experienced is 'overheating', like wtf man it goes till 42.5°C while charging and 41°C while gaming at a room temperature of 30 degrees!!2) Too much bloatware from the app market (although you can clear it).3) build quality/looks:-  The built quality can be improved, both frame and back comes with a plastic material and No Gorrila glass too:)4) Should also have included NFC tap to pay or Gorrila glass as most phone's at this price are providing any one of them.5) Antutu scores: When I ran antutu test, it scored nearly 670k (BTW they've said 750k)👎🏻. Although 670k was a good score, it was much lesser than what they've said(750k).Final verdict: This phone was mainly focused on gaming and performance, if you are a mobile gamer or need a good performance mobile, you can go for it. If you prefer good camera and build quality/design this  might not be a better choice for you!!This phone worked well for me!! I advice you to check other reviews too:)Read more; My ratings 4.45/5⭐Okay! I'm writing this review after one month of usage.

Although 670k was a good score, it was much lesser than what they've said(750k).Final verdict: This phone was mainly focused on gaming and performance, if you are a mobile gamer or need a good performance mobile, you can go for it. If you prefer good camera and build quality/design this  might not be a better choice for you!!This phone worked well for me!! I advice you to check other reviews too:); So far is good. I do face some problem during going back sometimes it's don't work. Although I knew about how it's focused on processor but front camera is really disappointed. I'm not talking about quality but it's beaut filter option it's so annoying I don't know how to turn it off or whether you can. Anyway gaming experience was good. Back camera is also good enough. Look is okay. Camera is kinda big compare to it's actual ability anyway I think it's worth the moneyRead more; So far is good. I do face some problem during going back sometimes it's don't work.

But it's not for these Gen z kids, UI and software is simple and clean. Not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.Phone is heating as common as other phones.Battery life average for 5000mahValue for money; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time.

I've been using samsung s22 ultra for 3.5 years before this and the immediate jump was highly visible.The main camera is amazing and works in every condition. I was surprised to see that night videos come out without noise and there are no luminous colorful noise dots on the video. The pictures you shoot are really good and after 3.5 years I've managed to take images of pets without the need to hold them still. The fastshot mode actually works. The 1.5x crop and 2x crop was magical. Since the sensor is big, these crops make it feel like it's being shot with an actual 1.5 and 2x lens.The 3x tele, even if reviewers have always said is not good enough, is actually good and shoots really good portrait. Actually all the lenses shoot really good portrait. The videos are also pretty balanced.The 4.3x is a literally a superbbbbb lens and you can literally shoot at 20 to 30x and find usable results. I was surprised at what this 'ai' tele can do! This is really good if you're 20 to 30 metres away from birds/animals. You can use this to shoot nice pics / videos.Please be warned that pictures come out like a mirrorless camera and the color science isn't like phones. That is a major reason you'll find most reviews to prefer vivo with their polished look. Highlights on skin are supposed to stay if you shoot in direct sun and the sun isn't supposed to look round if you shoot it above 45 degrees. I love the fact that computational photography has been dialled down in this phone. You can always do those things in post with any good software. I hate the over processed look and this suffices for my case.Leaving the camera aside, I'd say this is a really good battery for a flagship. I end the day with around 40 to 50 percent at times, and I'm a heavy user. I use a lot of camera; like a lot of it. I use a lot of youtube and instagram. I edit photos. I also listen to music at least 3 hours in a day while working. All thing combined I'm getting a screen on time of more than 8 hours.The phone is absolutely smooth and no complaints there. It's been a month and I've not faced even one stutter. I sold off my mi 11 ultra after 2 months of use due to multiple issues. It's not the case anymore. I don't see any polish difference between samsung and this phone. I can't relate to the fact that samsung makes a better experience. People keep talking about it, but I'm not sure I can relate. But yes, there are things I miss like samsung pay (google pay works on this one though), ultra wide band to search for my smart watch (i just let it ring now), a night mode on the camera (i think xiaomi has been over confident and has not included a night mode. I agree that shots come out really good even without one but including one would be good. And please include an astrophotography mode as well. All it has is auto night mode now. There's no dedicated mode).I can't find any other deterrents as of now. It's good for the priceRead more; Xiaomi has taken strides this time to make sure the camera works. I've been using samsung s22 ultra for 3.5 years before this and the immediate jump was highly visible.The main camera is amazing and works in every condition. I was surprised to see that night videos come out without noise and there are no luminous colorful noise dots on the video. The pictures you shoot are really good and after 3.5 years I've managed to take images of pets without the need to hold them still. The fastshot mode actually works. The 1.5x crop and 2x crop was magical. Since the sensor is big, these crops make it feel like it's being shot with an actual 1.5 and 2x lens.The 3x tele, even if reviewers have always said is not good enough, is actually good and shoots really good portrait. Actually all the lenses shoot really good portrait. The videos are also pretty balanced.The 4.3x is a literally a superbbbbb lens and you can literally shoot at 20 to 30x and find usable results. I was surprised at what this 'ai' tele can do! This is really good if you're 20 to 30 metres away from birds/animals. You can use this to shoot nice pics / videos.Please be warned that pictures come out like a mirrorless camera and the color science isn't like phones. That is a major reason you'll find most reviews to prefer vivo with their polished look. Highlights on skin are supposed to stay if you shoot in direct sun and the sun isn't supposed to look round if you shoot it above 45 degrees. I love the fact that computational photography has been dialled down in this phone. You can always do those things in post with any good software. I hate the over processed look and this suffices for my case.Leaving the camera aside, I'd say this is a really good battery for a flagship.

It captures detailed, vibrant photos, and its low-light capabilities are impressive. The device handles heavy apps and multitasking smoothly, and the gaming experience is excellent thanks to its powerful chipset and high refresh rate display.However, there's a minor lag when switching between camera modes, which could be improved with future updates. Also, the large camera bump on the back makes the phone wobble on flat surfaces—so it's definitely a good idea to use a protective case for better grip and stability.Overall, the Xiaomi 15 Ultra is a powerhouse with premium features, ideal for photography enthusiasts and gamers alike.Read more; The Xiaomi 15 Ultra delivers outstanding performance, with one of the best cameras in the flagship segment.

With moderate usage on WiFi, can easily last upto 2 days. Also, there is very less battery drain when idle, especially overnight. Definitely one of the best with 6000 mAh. One of my primary reasons to buy this phone.- Camera quality at this price is way above average.- Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point.- One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations.- No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer.- Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.Cons:- Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g.- Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated.- Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage.- There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates.- Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram. Ultra wide camera, 50MB camera with Sony sensor and OIS. Super Amoled display and 6000 MaH battery. UI is also good. Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.Read more; I have searched lot of phones in this price range, no one giving you all in one phone. Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram.

Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center.

While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.Update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.Read more; First impressions:1. While it has a LCD display.

But it's not for these Gen z kids, UI and software is simple and clean. Not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.Phone is heating as common as other phones.Battery life average for 5000mahValue for money; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time.

And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.; Phone look like a beast nice look nice cameras nicely batteryRead more; Phone look like a beast nice look nice cameras nicely battery; Product is ok but delivery is very poor struggled to get the delivery the item in amazon.

Metal build phone which feels premium and a notch above the rest of its competitors. Design is just pleasant to look at.2. Software after Android 15 and Oxygen os 15 update has become even more smooth and snappy which makes everyday use more refined and premium.3. With snapdragon 7+ gen 3 this phone is fast and feels like a flagship. Played games like BGMI and COD at 90 fps without any frames drop.4. Battery backup is amazing and it easily gives me 8 hrs plus SOT on day to day balanced use and 7+ hrs on a heavy use. I charge ones a day and next day I am still left with few more minutes before charging. Plus 100W superfast charger is cherry on top5. Haptics are just exceptioal and performs better than many flagship phones.6. The long software and security support also gives this phone a better chance to retain its resale value for longer period than its competitors.7. Clean software experience though it came with few bloatwares with its own app market but after deleting those apps and disabling the app market the experience has been overall great.8. This comes with flat screen which is great considering many good phone under this price segment have curve screens.Cons:-1. Camera is good but could have been better. Not a camera guy so it works for me but may not for the ones who want best camera for their buck.2. The front glass is not from the Corning thus should be handled with care and a screen tempered glass is must for this one.So in the end this is currently amongst the best balanced phone one could buy for this price and can experience a great phone at such low price.Read more; Writing this Review After 20 days use and I can say this phone doesn't disappoint.Pros :-1.

The first thing that stood out is how light it feels in the hand, the build quality is sleek and solid, almost mimicking an iPhone-level finish. It has a premium touch without the premium price.Performance-wise, it’s smooth and responsive. Apps open quickly, multitasking is a breeze, and there’s been no lag so far. The 8GB RAM with 256GB storage is more than enough for my daily use — whether it's gaming, streaming, or work. The indisplay Fingerprint sensor is so fast and soo cool.The screen size is perfect. Not too big, not too small, just right for comfortable viewing, typing, and media consumption. Colors are good, and brightness is on point, even outdoors.Obsidian Black looks stunning, clean, classy, and minimal. Overall, for the price point, the OnePlus Nord 4 is delivering way more than expected.Read more; Been using this phone for 2 days now.

Overall, for the price point, the OnePlus Nord 4 is delivering way more than expected.; I am writing this review after 1 month of using the Oneplus Nord 4. It is one of the best midrange phone that you can blindly buy without any confusion. I bought this phone during Great Indian festival after so much research and doubts. I was not sure which phone will be the best in 30000 segment. I was looking for a balanced phone which has everything like good performance, good design, good battery and good camera. I don't want to compromise in any one thing. So after lot of research i was having confusion between nord 4 and realme gt 6t. But in realme gt 6t the display is curved which i don't prefer at all. Curved display is waste of money and feels like gimmick so i avoided it and bought nord 4. Now i feel it was the best decision.Best features of this Nord 4 are-Design - I literally loved the mercurian silver metel design which looks so much premium. I thought metel might be heavier but in daily use its not a problem at all. It cools down so fast and does not have any heating issues at all.Performance - It has the best performance and able to play BGMI so smoothly. Flat screen helps so much in games also.Battery -  If you use normally the battery will last more than 1 day easily and it charges the phone within 25mins.Camera - I felt the main camera is so good and it takes very decent photos. 50mp camera performs above average. If camera is your main priority then its better to go for realme, vivo, Samsung or Iphone which are camera centric. But then other areas you have to compromise. Trust me below 30k this phone takes very good photos.Network - Being a metel phone i am getting 5g network always without any problem. Never felt any Issues at all.Display - It has best display and content viewing experience is top notch with minimum bezzels.This review is genuine and trust me if you want a balanced midrange phone you can go for Oneplus Nord 4 for sure. Greenline is coming in all the brands so no need to get back from this phone because of this reason....(If any problems comes in future then i will update the review for sure)Read more; I am writing this review after 1 month of using the Oneplus Nord 4.

The gaming isnt bad at all, easily 60+ fps on high settings in most games.. smooth experience overall with 120hz refresh rate and very nice 4k support. Enjoyable 5500 mah battery. Extended use may cause a little bit of heating as in my personal case but other than that, the phone charges in about an hour from 0 to 100 and the backup lasts for a day and a half. Only thing i would change in this phone is a little heating issue. Go for it under 20k.Read more; The device is the absolute best when it comes to being overall balanced in all sectors, within the 20k price range.

It's user friendly.; My ratings 4.45/5⭐Okay! I'm writing this review after one month of usage. I played BGMI and FF, ran antutu test and cpu throttling too..Pros:-1) Gaming:-  No doubt that this is the best phone for gaming at this price segment, I played both FF and BGMI on this device, the dimensity 7300 processor runs so smoothly so that you can experience a lag free gaming even in high graphics/resolution. (To experience true 90FPS gaming you need to turn on the GT mode).2)Performance:- Gaming phones generally do perform well on normal usage too, same here, the processor was good enough and runs smoothly even on multitasking. (Can give a max of 120hz refresh rate). Performance wise no doubt, you will be satisfied!3)Design and display: The 6.67 inch OLED display was really good and appreciable!4)Camera:- Although primarily this was not a camera phone but still the picture quality was fine and good, with a 50mp back camera and 16mp front camera (Back camera was better though).5)Battery:- Battery backup was good, comes with a 45W supervoc UF inbox charger, Takes almost 1 hr 20 mins to charge fully from zero. Can give a full working day backup on normal usage.6) Sound quality:- Sound quality was fine, The stereo speakers are loud and clear, For calls they've included clear voice(ENC) feature too.(There was no Dolby Atmos BTW, should 've included it! :)7) Comfort in hand: Trust me, this mobile is really comfortable in hand while holding and gaming. You don't feel any slipperiness.Cons:-1) The main problem i personally experienced is 'overheating', like wtf man it goes till 42.5°C while charging and 41°C while gaming at a room temperature of 30 degrees!!2) Too much bloatware from the app market (although you can clear it).3) build quality/looks:-  The built quality can be improved, both frame and back comes with a plastic material and No Gorrila glass too:)4) Should also have included NFC tap to pay or Gorrila glass as most phone's at this price are providing any one of them.5) Antutu scores: When I ran antutu test, it scored nearly 670k (BTW they've said 750k)👎🏻. Although 670k was a good score, it was much lesser than what they've said(750k).Final verdict: This phone was mainly focused on gaming and performance, if you are a mobile gamer or need a good performance mobile, you can go for it. If you prefer good camera and build quality/design this  might not be a better choice for you!!This phone worked well for me!! I advice you to check other reviews too:)Read more; My ratings 4.45/5⭐Okay! I'm writing this review after one month of usage.

But this phone turned out to be so ""DISAPPOINTING"" that you can only understand after using it. You have to use both hands to open the flap while answering the calls hence no Swag. The outside volume button are so annoying, you cannot put this phone on only vibration mode via the volume button you have to open settings to do that( only no ring no vibration can be done). This phone will turn silent(no vibration) in the pocket on its own because the volume button keep pressing in the pocket when you walk(no exaggeration its true). Battery is also not as good as advertised,  1 to 2 days max depending upon usage. It has no WhatsApp, internet is also basic most of the online videos and pictures do not open. Keypad is also not that good its difficult to type.

While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.Update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.Read more; First impressions:1. While it has a LCD display.

And about CODM,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. Crazy good phone for CODM. For FC Mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. The lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. For codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed B in coastal S&D and 4 players were camping there. In FC Mobile no drops straight up 60. Crazy performance. The cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. So if you want natural photo than it's not good. Display is Crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. One more thing that is annoying is the UI, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. Good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy.

Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions. In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer.Read more; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions.

The back is smooth to touch, and feels smooth to use.; It's been a month using this phone. Here is what I liked,1. Lag free performance. Apps install, open very quickly. Even Banking apps open and work very smoothly.2. Screen. Very vivid and bright. Didn't notice any change on refresh rate side.3. Fast Charging. 100% charge within 15-20 minutes.4. Battery Backup. Lasts 2 days with mild usage.5. Call Quality. Despite having a single mic, call quality is good.6. Camera. Though it lacked few advanced features like slow motion recording, 4K 60 fps recording, still camera quality is good. Captures very good shots in day light but looses a bit of details in low light but still good enough. 3x zoom also a good feature. Selfie camera is also satisfactory.Didn't like,1. Speaker. I was using Redmi Note7 Pro for last 6 years and was expecting similar sound quality. Its a single speaker setup and sound is not that deep like of Note7 Pro.2. Build. Its a bit bulky. If you have short hand than you will struggle to use it with a single hand.Overall good phone. Want Pro features than go for Note Pro.Read more; It's been a month using this phone.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed.

While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.Update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.Read more; First impressions:1. While it has a LCD display.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center.

And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.; ProsDisplay is very impressive, Samsung one UI is very good and useful.

But it's not for these Gen z kids, UI and software is simple and clean. Not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.Phone is heating as common as other phones.Battery life average for 5000mahValue for money; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time.

I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.; Phone look like a beast nice look nice cameras nicely batteryRead more; Phone look like a beast nice look nice cameras nicely battery; Product is ok but delivery is very poor struggled to get the delivery the item in amazon.

The display is vibrant, the UI is smooth for daily tasks, and the build feels premium for its price. It handles most apps and media consumption well, making it a decent phone for everyday use.However, there are a few noticeable downsides. The device tends to heat up quite a bit, especially during charging or while using demanding apps. Speaking of charging, it’s slower than expected—even with the provided charger, it takes longer than most phones in the same range. The fingerprint sensor is another letdown. It's not very accurate or fast, and sometimes it doesn't work at all, which can be frustrating.Despite the heating issues, slow charging, and unreliable fingerprint sensor, the phone still manages to deliver a good all-round experience. If you can overlook those flaws, the Galaxy A36 is a decent option in the mid-range category.Read more; I’ve been using the Samsung Galaxy A36 for a while now, and here’s my honest take on it.The overall performance and design of the phone are solid.

Despite the front camera being 12MP and the main one 50MP, the photo quality has exceeded my expectations. Samsung’s image processing really makes a difference. The latest UI 7 is smooth, intuitive, and packed with useful features that enhance the overall experience.As someone who’s been a Samsung user for over 10 years—my previous phone was the F62—I was initially hesitant about this purchase because of the price. A lot of people around me said it was too expensive. But now that I’ve used it, I can confidently say it’s worth every penny, especially if you’re someone who doesn’t game all day but needs a reliable, high-performing phone for personal or business use.One thing that truly surprised me was how fast the data transferred—everything moved over in under 6 minutes, and I was honestly shocked. I use Samsung Notes extensively and had over 1,200 notes, yet they were transferred flawlessly along with all my images and videos. That level of efficiency made the transition effortless.The charging speed is solid too. Of course, like any device, battery life depends on usage. If you're running brightness at 90–100%, you'll need to recharge more often. While the phone doesn’t support expandable storage, the built-in 256GB is more than enough for most users—unless you're constantly vlogging or shooting 4K content.Another huge advantage is the long-term value: this device comes with 6 years of OS upgrades, which is rare in today’s smartphone market. That alone puts it ahead of many competitors and gives me confidence in its longevity.In short, I highly recommend this phone. It’s a powerful, future-proof choice that balances performance, design, and usability perfectly. Don’t let the price talk scare you—it’s absolutely justified by what you’re getting in return.Read more; I've been using my new Samsung device for a month now, and I’m genuinely impressed with how well it performs.

The phone sometimes heats up while charging or when 120 fps is unlocked but it isn't that big of deal, like it doesn't overheat and given the fps it provides the little heating is justified. The cameras are better than expected and the battery life is phenomenal, easily lasts 1.5-2 days on moderate usage. The display and haptics are top notch too.

The cameras are better than expected and the battery life is phenomenal, easily lasts 1.5-2 days on moderate usage. The display and haptics are top notch too. Just funtouch os needs some refinement which I hope will be solved with future updates. Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi. And about CODM,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. Crazy good phone for CODM. For FC Mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. The lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. For codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed B in coastal S&D and 4 players were camping there. In FC Mobile no drops straight up 60. Crazy performance. The cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. So if you want natural photo than it's not good. Display is Crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. One more thing that is annoying is the UI, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. Good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy. Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.Read more; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi.

Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions. In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer.Read more; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions.

However, this experience has been an absolute disappointment on multiple fronts.After an accidental fall, the phone’s glass broke, and a large black patch appeared on the display, making it unusable. When I contacted Honor’s service centers, I was informed that sourcing spare parts was a persistent issue. Despite submitting my phone for repair at a larger service center, even seven months later, the required parts have not arrived, leaving my phone unrepaired.To make matters worse, after a software update, the phone developed green and pink lines on the display—an issue widely reported online as being linked to faulty software. These lines often worsen over time, and with no replacement parts available, the phone remains inoperable.Additionally, the device suffers from poor signal reception. Despite being marketed as a 5G phone, it struggles to maintain consistent network connectivity, even in areas where other devices perform perfectly. This affects basic usability like calls, browsing, and app functionality, which is unacceptable for a phone in this price range.Attempts to seek assistance from Amazon were futile, as they redirected me to Honor, stating post-sale responsibility lies with the manufacturer. Honor's lack of accountability, unreliable software updates, unavailability of parts, and subpar network performance have made this the worst smartphone purchase I’ve ever made.I regret choosing Honor and strongly advise others to avoid this brand. If you value reliable service, quality hardware, and consistent network performance, look elsewhere.

First thing I did after getting the phone is turn OFF all software update due to fear of getting Green Line issue as reported by many users. Second Do Not put any back cover or use any tempered glass as it blocks the heat tranfer which Is also one of the main cause of green line. Lastly do not use any fast charger as the phone is capable of recieving only 2 amp during charging and slows down charging due to heat generated during charging. . I am using only 1 amp charger. Also set screen refresh rate to 60hz. The battery life of this phone is very good but battery is producing lot of heat and this phone does not have any cooling system and poor heat managment.  I also have iqoo Z9X in our family which has same SNAPDRAGON 6 GEN 1 chipset and bigger battery but it runs very Cool.  Huawei needs to work on heat management in their phone as nobody wants to spend 12k on new display. There is no call recording by default but you can use third party app like ""Cube ACR"" for call recording.Camera is ok but has really good night mode but no OIS which not acceptable at this price point. Overall it's good phone but I am not sure if this phone will survice hot Indian summer but So far it's working good.Read more; After Using this phone for last 3 months and here are obervations.

While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.Update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.Read more; First impressions:1. While it has a LCD display.

Display is pretty good. Battery is ok with fast charging facility. The only thing I don't like is that the phone sometimes loses network access or becomes slow while surfing internet. An aeroplane mode has to be applied to restore its previous speed. This happens rarely but happens. Otherwise nothing to complain about. Pure Indian brand.

Metal build phone which feels premium and a notch above the rest of its competitors. Design is just pleasant to look at.2. Software after Android 15 and Oxygen os 15 update has become even more smooth and snappy which makes everyday use more refined and premium.3. With snapdragon 7+ gen 3 this phone is fast and feels like a flagship. Played games like BGMI and COD at 90 fps without any frames drop.4. Battery backup is amazing and it easily gives me 8 hrs plus SOT on day to day balanced use and 7+ hrs on a heavy use. I charge ones a day and next day I am still left with few more minutes before charging. Plus 100W superfast charger is cherry on top5. Haptics are just exceptioal and performs better than many flagship phones.6. The long software and security support also gives this phone a better chance to retain its resale value for longer period than its competitors.7. Clean software experience though it came with few bloatwares with its own app market but after deleting those apps and disabling the app market the experience has been overall great.8. This comes with flat screen which is great considering many good phone under this price segment have curve screens.Cons:-1. Camera is good but could have been better. Not a camera guy so it works for me but may not for the ones who want best camera for their buck.2. The front glass is not from the Corning thus should be handled with care and a screen tempered glass is must for this one.So in the end this is currently amongst the best balanced phone one could buy for this price and can experience a great phone at such low price.Read more; Writing this Review After 20 days use and I can say this phone doesn't disappoint.Pros :-1.

The first thing that stood out is how light it feels in the hand, the build quality is sleek and solid, almost mimicking an iPhone-level finish. It has a premium touch without the premium price.Performance-wise, it’s smooth and responsive. Apps open quickly, multitasking is a breeze, and there’s been no lag so far. The 8GB RAM with 256GB storage is more than enough for my daily use — whether it's gaming, streaming, or work. The indisplay Fingerprint sensor is so fast and soo cool.The screen size is perfect. Not too big, not too small, just right for comfortable viewing, typing, and media consumption. Colors are good, and brightness is on point, even outdoors.Obsidian Black looks stunning, clean, classy, and minimal.

Overall, for the price point, the OnePlus Nord 4 is delivering way more than expected.; I am writing this review after 1 month of using the Oneplus Nord 4. It is one of the best midrange phone that you can blindly buy without any confusion. I bought this phone during Great Indian festival after so much research and doubts. I was not sure which phone will be the best in 30000 segment. I was looking for a balanced phone which has everything like good performance, good design, good battery and good camera. I don't want to compromise in any one thing. So after lot of research i was having confusion between nord 4 and realme gt 6t. But in realme gt 6t the display is curved which i don't prefer at all. Curved display is waste of money and feels like gimmick so i avoided it and bought nord 4. Now i feel it was the best decision.Best features of this Nord 4 are-Design - I literally loved the mercurian silver metel design which looks so much premium. I thought metel might be heavier but in daily use its not a problem at all. It cools down so fast and does not have any heating issues at all.Performance - It has the best performance and able to play BGMI so smoothly. Flat screen helps so much in games also.Battery -  If you use normally the battery will last more than 1 day easily and it charges the phone within 25mins.Camera - I felt the main camera is so good and it takes very decent photos. 50mp camera performs above average. If camera is your main priority then its better to go for realme, vivo, Samsung or Iphone which are camera centric. But then other areas you have to compromise. Trust me below 30k this phone takes very good photos.Network - Being a metel phone i am getting 5g network always without any problem. Never felt any Issues at all.Display - It has best display and content viewing experience is top notch with minimum bezzels.This review is genuine and trust me if you want a balanced midrange phone you can go for Oneplus Nord 4 for sure. Greenline is coming in all the brands so no need to get back from this phone because of this reason....(If any problems comes in future then i will update the review for sure)Read more; I am writing this review after 1 month of using the Oneplus Nord 4.

Can't believe they removed review option for this product after its launch. Not a good move by Apple of Android.Now, on with the show :+ You get Amoled screen- Not very good in direct sunlight or outdoors. Auto brightness doesn't work well. I can live with notch though.+ 6 years of update ""promised"" (not guaranteed)- Still in android 14 and in January patch at the time of this review.+ NFC support- Never used this feature once.+ Performance is good for the budget. I don't play games.- Worst front facing camera I used. And I have always used budget phones.+ Back camera is average. Didn't use it much though.- I do miss stereo speakers during video calls or music playing. (I also have Realme P1 as a primary)+ Battery is also average. Not great not worst.- No charger. Seriously. And charge time is just insanely high for a 5000mah Battery.+ OneUI is great.- Bloatware install during setup and hidden settings is not great.- Only 3 fingerprints can be added. More would have been nice.- UFS 2.2 storage is slow and not at all worth it. App installation is going to take more time than downloading it.Suggestions :> Use light theme throughout the day.> Disable unwanted apps.> If you use it yourself or give this to your parents or any one, please disable glance and disable any bloatware you don't want.> F16 was launched a bit cheaper than this one.

Especially from the performance aspect, the snapdragon 8s gen3 performs like a flagship beast giving stable 120 fps in COD mobile, bgmi and other demanding games. The phone sometimes heats up while charging or when 120 fps is unlocked but it isn't that big of deal, like it doesn't overheat and given the fps it provides the little heating is justified. The cameras are better than expected and the battery life is phenomenal, easily lasts 1.5-2 days on moderate usage. The display and haptics are top notch too. Just funtouch os needs some refinement which I hope will be solved with future updates. Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍Read more; Good phone all in all.

And about CODM,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. Crazy good phone for CODM. For FC Mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. The lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. For codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed B in coastal S&D and 4 players were camping there. In FC Mobile no drops straight up 60. Crazy performance. The cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. So if you want natural photo than it's not good. Display is Crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. One more thing that is annoying is the UI, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. Good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy. Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.Read more; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi.

In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer.Read more; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions.

The design is absolutely stunning – the curved display and vegan leather back feel premium and look fantastic. The display itself is vibrant and smooth, perfect for watching videos and browsing.Performance-wise, it handles everyday tasks and moderate gaming with ease. The processor is snappy, and I haven't experienced any significant lag. The camera system is decent, producing good photos in daylight, although low-light performance could be better.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed.

Initially made an order on 8 October. But within two days saw a price reduction. Cancelled the order but card was maxed out. By the time I could purchase, that offer was long lost. Bought this with an exchange on 24th October and received it on 27th October. Quick shipping by Amazon. Yet, recently, I have begun having doubts in this regard.Pros regarding the phone:1. Awesome packaging.2. Battery is excellent. Lasts more than a day for me. Perhaps its because I am not into social apps.3. Love the front screen. Added Max onto the screen and it is spectacular. He makes my day at times.4. Above all, it is a dream come true for me. Have longed for a flip phone since I saw Moto Razr in 2006 or so.Cons regarding the phone:1. Hardware is not up to the price. The price becomes worth if only you enjoy flipping open the phone.2. One hand usage is not advised. The phone is most likely to fall on the floor. As such, we need both hands to be free when attending calls.3. I had ordered the mystic dawn color. So the case that came with it is purple in color. It has sort of become dirty due to usage.4. My return period ended on 3 November. Till then the phone was alright. On 4th, I found that the hinges had become slightly loose when you keep the phone in 90 degree open position, and the upper part would shake. Don't know if this is how it is meant to be. I'm yet to contact customer care (Carlcare).Update:I had taken a lot of care in handling the phone. However a simple fall from my hand was all that was required. The phone fell from a short height. Yet in that single fall, the hinges got damaged. Upon opening the screen, found that also damaged. Visited the nearest carlcare service center and they quoted 34k excluding taxes for the repair. Another irony is that I have six months EMI remaining.Read more; I bought this phone only because of the craze towards a flipping phone since my teenage. Initially made an order on 8 October.

While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.Update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.Read more; First impressions:1. While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7.

Not only stunning but it is safer/easier on the eys with 3840 pwd dimming. Videos, photos, games look great on it. It gets crazy bright too.Processor- SD 8gen 3 performance is at par usual use. Gaming is good, multitasking is easy and it performs as expected. This is a quick phone. Not a heavy gamer  but pretty sure it'll handle even heavy games quite well!Battery-5200 lasts for a day and half for moderate usage. Heavy users will see it dropping in a day. Charging is fast (100watts, wired). In 20 minutes, you will see battery charged at 50% from 5%.Camera- 50MP cameras take stunning images to say the least. Portrates are amazing, HDR balances the exposure appropriately, night photography is good as well. Clicks are so good that they are comparable with DSLRs!

But it's not for these Gen z kids, UI and software is simple and clean. Not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.Phone is heating as common as other phones.Battery life average for 5000mahValue for money; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time.

But it's not for these Gen z kids, UI and software is simple and clean. Not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.Phone is heating as common as other phones.Battery life average for 5000mahValue for money; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time.

You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.; Phone look like a beast nice look nice cameras nicely batteryRead more; Phone look like a beast nice look nice cameras nicely battery; Product is ok but delivery is very poor struggled to get the delivery the item in amazon.

Here is my detailed review about this phone.Setup - 4/5: It takes a while to setup. Could have been easier to get to the main screen to begin the operation. However, the setup instructions were pretty clear.Display - 5/5: Sports a great 6.7” inch SuperAmoLED display, very impressed with the colours on this budget phone.Camera - 3/5: Camera quality lags behind similar phones in this budget range. Samsung has some work to do here. The video I posted also has a video taken, where one could see artificial color enhancing without staying true to the colors. Which an iPhone faithfully reproduces. So far this is also a widespread Android problem. Also, no 4K video recording, while it’s available on Samsung M35 which is in the same budget range.Speed of Operation-4.5/5: The device is pretty smooth for an user like me who seldom uses it for gaming, but use it frequently to access interactive AI apps, stock market apps, hotel booking, payment and secured payment through Samsung Wallet as this device has an NFC.Security - 5/5: This device is for someone for whom data privacy and security matters. The device comes with Samsung Knox. Samsung is the only brand in Android so far on which I can place my trust the rest come fancy features, but they come at a cost of compromising your security with built-in Bloatwares that are capable of monitoring your activities.OS - 4.5/5: Comes with Android 14, decent improvements over previous Versions. Promised 6 years of OS Upgrades, not sure if the device can keep up with the changes of the new OS requirements.Battery-4.5/5: Decent lasts 1 and half days easily despite of 7-8 hours usage in a single day.Body - 4/5: Very stylish, glossy finish and great colors. Be careful to use a back cover as the phone can slip away easily because of its size and the glossy finish.Mobile connectivity -4/5: Connects to 5G where available, otherwise works great on VoLTE. The device has WiFi calling feature, which sometimes can be the reason for intermittent call breaking especially when you move away from WiFi but a call on WhatsApp goes well.Anomalies: None so far.

Factor that in the cost of purchase and when comparing with other similarly priced phones.- Auto brightness sensor is pathetic. The phone randomly reduces and increases brightness to uncomfortable or unreadable levels for no apparent reason.Read more; This is a very basic phone with average performance.

Can't believe they removed review option for this product after its launch. Not a good move by Apple of Android.Now, on with the show :+ You get Amoled screen- Not very good in direct sunlight or outdoors. Auto brightness doesn't work well. I can live with notch though.+ 6 years of update ""promised"" (not guaranteed)- Still in android 14 and in January patch at the time of this review.+ NFC support- Never used this feature once.+ Performance is good for the budget. I don't play games.- Worst front facing camera I used. And I have always used budget phones.+ Back camera is average. Didn't use it much though.- I do miss stereo speakers during video calls or music playing. (I also have Realme P1 as a primary)+ Battery is also average. Not great not worst.- No charger. Seriously. And charge time is just insanely high for a 5000mah Battery.+ OneUI is great.- Bloatware install during setup and hidden settings is not great.- Only 3 fingerprints can be added. More would have been nice.- UFS 2.2 storage is slow and not at all worth it. App installation is going to take more time than downloading it.Suggestions :> Use light theme throughout the day.> Disable unwanted apps.> If you use it yourself or give this to your parents or any one, please disable glance and disable any bloatware you don't want.> F16 was launched a bit cheaper than this one. Go for that one.Overall it is good for the price. It does exactly what I need. Nothing more, nothing less.Read more; Reviews are finally up.

Performance is blazing fast apps open instantly, gaming is smooth, and multitasking is seamless. The 120Hz display adds a super smooth touch to everything. Easily one of the best phones for speed, camera, and overall experience!; The iQOO 13 arrives as a no-compromise flagship, blending raw performance, gamer-centric optimizations, and sleek design into a device that aims to redefine the ""performance smartphone"" category. With upgrades like the latest Snapdragon chipset, a revamped cooling system, and a display that’s buttery smooth, this phone is engineered for power users and mobile gamers. After weeks of testing, here’s our take.---### **Key Features Breakdown**1. **Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 + LPDDR5X RAM & UFS 4.0 Storage**:The iQOO 13 is powered by Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, paired with up to 16GB RAM and 512GB storage. This combo delivers blistering speeds for multitasking, app launches, and gaming. *Genshin Impact* and *Honkai: Star Rail* run at near-max settings with zero stutters, even during marathon sessions.2. **6.78-inch AMOLED Display (144Hz Refresh Rate)**:The 1.5K AMOLED screen is a visual treat, offering vibrant colors, deep blacks, and a buttery 144Hz refresh rate. HDR10+ support and 3,000 nits peak brightness make outdoor visibility stellar. Gamers will love the 2,000Hz instant touch sampling rate for ultra-responsive controls.3. **Dual Cryo-Vapor Cooling System**:iQOO’s upgraded cooling tech keeps thermals in check during intense gaming. Even after an hour of *PUBG Mobile*, the phone stays comfortably warm—not scalding—with no performance throttling.4. **120W Fast Charging + 5,500mAh Battery**:The 5,500mAh battery lasts a full day of heavy use (6-7 hours screen-on time). When drained, the 120W charger juices it up to 50% in **10 minutes** and 100% in **25 minutes**. Wireless charging is notably absent, though.5. **Triple Camera Setup (50MP + 50MP + 64MP)**:The main 50MP Sony IMX966 sensor captures crisp, dynamic shots in daylight. The 64MP 3x periscope telephoto lens is a standout for sharp zoom (up to 10x hybrid), while low-light performance is decent but not class-leading. The 50MP ultra-wide avoids distortion at the edges.6. **Funtouch OS 14 (Android 14)**:iQOO’s skin is cleaner than before but still includes bloatware. Gaming features like *Monster Mode* (unlocks full CPU/GPU power) and *4D Game Vibration* (haptic feedback synced to in-game actions) add immersion.---### **Performance & Experience**- **Gaming**: This is where the iQOO 13 shines. The combo of Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, 144Hz display, and touch sampling makes it a mobile gaming beast. Paired with accessories like the iQOO Cooler, it’s a legitimate portable console.- **Daily Use**: Apps fly open, and the UI feels snappy. The flat-edge design offers a premium grip, though the glossy back attracts fingerprints (opt for the vegan leather variant).- **Audio**: Stereo speakers are loud and clear, but audiophiles will miss a headphone jack.---### **Pros vs. Cons****Pros**:✅ Unmatched gaming performance with sustained thermal management.✅ Gorgeous 144Hz AMOLED display with best-in-class touch response.✅ Blazing 120W charging and solid battery life.✅ Versatile camera setup for a performance-focused phone.**Cons**:❌ No wireless charging or IP68 rating (expected at this price).❌ Funtouch OS still feels cluttered compared to stock Android.❌ Bulky at 209g—not ideal for one-handed use.---### **Final Verdict**The iQOO 13 isn’t just a phone; it’s a statement for gamers and power users who refuse to compromise. While it lacks polish in areas like software and premium durability features, its performance, display, and charging speed make it a top contender in the flagship arena.**Who should buy it?**- Mobile gamers craving desktop-level performance.- Users who prioritize charging speed and screen smoothness.- Photography enthusiasts who want a competent camera *and* a powerhouse chipset.**Rating**: 4.3/5 — A near-perfect performance machine held back by minor omissions.*Bottom Line*: If raw power and gaming dominance top your checklist, the iQOO 13 is a thrill ride worth the ticket. For everyone else, wait for a sale or consider more balanced flagships. 🎮⚡Read more; The iQOO 13 arrives as a no-compromise flagship, blending raw performance, gamer-centric optimizations, and sleek design into a device that aims to redefine the ""performance smartphone"" category.

Gaming features like *Monster Mode* (unlocks full CPU/GPU power) and *4D Game Vibration* (haptic feedback synced to in-game actions) add immersion.---### **Performance & Experience**- **Gaming**: This is where the iQOO 13 shines. The combo of Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, 144Hz display, and touch sampling makes it a mobile gaming beast. Paired with accessories like the iQOO Cooler, it’s a legitimate portable console.- **Daily Use**: Apps fly open, and the UI feels snappy. The flat-edge design offers a premium grip, though the glossy back attracts fingerprints (opt for the vegan leather variant).- **Audio**: Stereo speakers are loud and clear, but audiophiles will miss a headphone jack.---### **Pros vs. Cons****Pros**:✅ Unmatched gaming performance with sustained thermal management.✅ Gorgeous 144Hz AMOLED display with best-in-class touch response.✅ Blazing 120W charging and solid battery life.✅ Versatile camera setup for a performance-focused phone.**Cons**:❌ No wireless charging or IP68 rating (expected at this price).❌ Funtouch OS still feels cluttered compared to stock Android.❌ Bulky at 209g—not ideal for one-handed use.---### **Final Verdict**The iQOO 13 isn’t just a phone; it’s a statement for gamers and power users who refuse to compromise. While it lacks polish in areas like software and premium durability features, its performance, display, and charging speed make it a top contender in the flagship arena.**Who should buy it?**- Mobile gamers craving desktop-level performance.- Users who prioritize charging speed and screen smoothness.- Photography enthusiasts who want a competent camera *and* a powerhouse chipset.**Rating**: 4.3/5 — A near-perfect performance machine held back by minor omissions.*Bottom Line*: If raw power and gaming dominance top your checklist, the iQOO 13 is a thrill ride worth the ticket. For everyone else, wait for a sale or consider more balanced flagships. 🎮⚡",smartphones,12

Especially from the performance aspect, the snapdragon 8s gen3 performs like a flagship beast giving stable 120 fps in COD mobile, bgmi and other demanding games. The phone sometimes heats up while charging or when 120 fps is unlocked but it isn't that big of deal, like it doesn't overheat and given the fps it provides the little heating is justified. The cameras are better than expected and the battery life is phenomenal, easily lasts 1.5-2 days on moderate usage. The display and haptics are top notch too. Just funtouch os needs some refinement which I hope will be solved with future updates. Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍Read more; Good phone all in all.

Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi. And about CODM,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. Crazy good phone for CODM. For FC Mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. The lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. For codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed B in coastal S&D and 4 players were camping there. In FC Mobile no drops straight up 60. Crazy performance. The cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. So if you want natural photo than it's not good. Display is Crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. One more thing that is annoying is the UI, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. Good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy. Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.Read more; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi. And about CODM,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. Crazy good phone for CODM. For FC Mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. The lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. For codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed B in coastal S&D and 4 players were camping there. In FC Mobile no drops straight up 60. Crazy performance. The cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. So if you want natural photo than it's not good.

Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions. In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer.Read more; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions.

Great Camera,  display, chipset, speakers, haptics built quality and awesome battery backup. Got a clean OS experience as well. The most important thing is the in hand feel. Simply superp. Please note that this is not a light weight device and the black colour looks fabulous at the same time slippery as well. Images won't justify the beauty of silky black varient. The curve on the display is very subtle compared to Moto phones. Using this device for almost 2 months now and no heating issues faced till time. Also receiving the OTA updates frequently. Im happy with my device.Read more; Everything about this product is great. Great Camera,  display, chipset, speakers, haptics built quality and awesome battery backup.

Im happy with my device.; TLDR; Great phone for buyers who are looking for a well-rounded phone which can do a bit of everything, but don't buy it if your top priority is the camera. I have judged the camera harshly because cameras are important in flagships.EDIT 1: A second update addressed some of the issues in the camera and fixed it. Some of the issues still remain (like overprocessing of photos indoors) but camera performs slightly better now so I'll increase the camera rating. Kudos to OnePlus for the prompt action.Display - 7.5/10Camera - 7.5/10Performance - 9/10Software - 8/10Battery - 9.5/10Connectivity - 9/10I upgraded from my OP9R to this and got a nice exchange bonus out of it. I had briefly used a Pixel 8 Pro as well, and while the software and camera were superior than the OP12, their hardware was outdated and I faced a lot of connectivity issues so I ended up returning the P8P.Note: I will say that when it comes to the overall phone experience and my personal requirements, OnePlus 12 is better than Pixel 8 Pro in my opinion and also ₹35k cheaper.This phone is already competitively priced so I got a good deal out of it. Here are my initial impressions -1. ACCESSORIES: Getting a charger and a phone case in 2024 out of the box makes me really happy. The case is okay but I would recommend getting a better one. The charger is big and heavy as it's 100W.2. DISPLAY: The display is - clarity and quality wise fantastic, and any media you play in a higher resolution will look phenomenal. The brightness is also quite ample even under full sunlight conditions.  Although 4500 nits is misleading but when you access HDR content, you will witness it's not entirely a gimmick. A display this good at this price is commendable.The display is also CURVED, which is worst thing about it. This is the first curved display phone I've used and it's a bad experience for me. The light glares on the curved parts break the immersion while watching videos or browsing, photo editing can be a pain, causes problems in copy-pasting texts, gathers a lot of dust and not to mention how they are susceptible to more damages even with a good case on. It gets worse in sunlight. It will take some getting used to but I will never like it.3. CAMERA: Camera has good clarity (the 10-bit mode can further enhance picture quality) but is also frustrating at times. There are a lot of moments when it overexposes, over sharpens and messes up the white balance in certain parts of photos after processing. I've had to manually tweak the exposure settings to get the scenes right a lot of times. Rear camera seflies indoors, sky pictures and sceneries with a lot of dynamic range come out weird after processing sometimes. The whole point of Hasselblad tuning is that the photos should be true-to-life. Sometimes pictures come out too warm indoors. Outdoors they perform better. I have had to use the Master Mode on Auto to take some pictures so that the processing does not ruin the picture. The downside of Master Mode is that your photos will end up looking a bit bland (because there's no post-processing happening) and it does not handle dynamic ranges well.QUICK TIP: Turn off the ProXDR mode from the inbuilt gallery settings. It exaggerates photo quality on your display but is useless outside your gallery once you upload those photos somewhere.Night mode is okay and gets the job done but don't expect it to perform a miracle with bad lighting conditions. Portrait mode is fantastic, edge-detection is very well-tuned. The Pro mode is where this camera shines and makes the use of the camera hardware but the majority won't use it. The glass coating on the camera is very susceptible to damage because it covers a better part of your phone's back so you will need to buy a good case.Digital zoom is not very good in my opinion considering IQOO 12 has done a much better job with it while being significantly cheaper.Video recordings from the rear camera come out clear enough and the audio quality is also good. But when you're switching lenses for zooming in, you'll notice a bit of stutter and a slight change in the colour gradient. When you're zooming in a lot, the camera takes 3-5 seconds before registering a focus object and detecting it properly. Super stable mode works well but only with 60fps. 30fps recording mode is not that smooth, with sub-par stabilization and stutters a lot when switching lenses. These have been an ongoing issue for a few generations and one would have expected OP to resolve it by now.Front camera is pretty average (even more disappointing indoors). It works well in daylight but indoor pictures look like they're taken from a mid-range phone. They did tune the front camera to have a wider angle which is good. Video recording from the front camera doesn't allow 60 fps but allows 4K recording now.OP clearly needs to work in the camera department in future updates. Their camera algorithms are quite behind compared to the current industry standards even though the phone has good camera hardware.Overall camera is okay for daily use but if it's your main priority, this phone might not be for you.4. CONNECTIVITY AND CALL QUALITY - Did not notice any call drops, 5G works well and the person on the other end heard my voice very loud and clear. Bluetooth and WIFI are working well.IR blaster works but don't expect it to be compatible with every device. Gets the job done regardless and a super convenient feature that I wish more phones had these days.5. BATTERY AND CHARGING - It is fantastic. Can last a full day on medium to heavy usage, and 1.5 days on light usage. They have also introduced battery health management features which is an added bonus. I had to try really hard to drain the battery completely.Charging time is 25-27 mins after full drainage. The smart charging feature to conserve battery health over time is a nice addition. Haven't used the wireless charging or reverse wireless charging so wouldn't be able to comment on it.My current SOT shows up as almost 9 hrs and 1d 5 hrs since last charge with 7% charge left. Battery is crazy good as you can see.6. PERFORMANCE: Top-notch performance, phone feels super fast and snappy. Got only slightly warm during gaming (I played CoDM), continuous camera operations and charging. Their new cooling system is proving to be very good.Read and write speeds, app installations are also super fast.7. SOFTWARE: Oxygen OS 14 has some very good parts (quick launch, smart sidebar, file docker etc), and some bad parts. There are some Android 14 features that have not been implemented correctly (why do I have to manually set refresh rates for all the apps even after selecting the high refresh rate option?) or are absent (where are the lock screen customisations?). OOS14 is still proving to be a good experience for me overall.I have not encountered any bugs in my day to day usage and every operation on the phone has been seamless so far. Honestly, I expected OP12 to be quite buggy at launch but I'm happy that they are learning from their mistakes.OP has managed to give great features in an extremely competitive price and I would say I'm mostly happy with my purchase (except maybe the camera). China models will see AI features soon and I hope global launches follow the suit.Read more; TLDR; Great phone for buyers who are looking for a well-rounded phone which can do a bit of everything, but don't buy it if your top priority is the camera.

The device turned out to be defective, and the experience that followed was nothing short of frustrating.The Initial ProblemUpon receiving the device, I noticed that it had significant issues, including voice breakdown during calls. I promptly contacted Amazon's customer support, expecting a seamless replacement or refund process. However, to my surprise, they refused to replace the device, suggesting that I contact Realme's support team instead.The RunaroundI reached out to Realme's support team, hoping that they would be more helpful. Unfortunately, the issue persisted, and I was told that the problem was not resolved. The voice breakdown during calls continued, rendering the device unusable.The Replacement and Refund Period*As per Amazon's policy, I was within the 7-day replacement and refund period. However, both Amazon and Realme seemed unwilling to take responsibility for the defective device. Realme's service center refused to provide a denial letter, which Amazon required for a refund.A Catch-22 SituationThis created a Catch-22 situation, where Amazon insisted that I needed a denial letter from Realme to process a refund, while Realme's service center refused to provide such a letter. I was left feeling frustrated and helpless, with no clear resolution in sight.A Call for Better Customer Support*As a customer, I expect a certain level of service from the companies I purchase from. In this case, both Amazon and Realme fell short of my expectations. I hope that they will take steps to improve their customer support and address the issues that I faced.*Rating*- Amazon: 1/5- Realme: 1/5*Recommendation*To anyone considering purchasing the Realme Narzo 61 or dealing with similar issues with these companies, I would advise exercising caution and being prepared for potential frustrations.

While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.Update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.Read more; First impressions:1. While it has a LCD display.

With moderate usage on WiFi, can easily last upto 2 days. Also, there is very less battery drain when idle, especially overnight. Definitely one of the best with 6000 mAh. One of my primary reasons to buy this phone.- Camera quality at this price is way above average.- Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point.- One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations.- No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer.- Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.Cons:- Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g.- Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated.- Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage.- There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates.- Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram. Ultra wide camera, 50MB camera with Sony sensor and OIS. Super Amoled display and 6000 MaH battery. UI is also good. Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.Read more; I have searched lot of phones in this price range, no one giving you all in one phone. Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram.

Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center.

But it's not for these Gen z kids, UI and software is simple and clean. Not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.Phone is heating as common as other phones.Battery life average for 5000mahValue for money; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time.

Performance is blazing fast apps open instantly, gaming is smooth, and multitasking is seamless. The 120Hz display adds a super smooth touch to everything. Easily one of the best phones for speed, camera, and overall experience!; The iQOO 13 arrives as a no-compromise flagship, blending raw performance, gamer-centric optimizations, and sleek design into a device that aims to redefine the ""performance smartphone"" category. With upgrades like the latest Snapdragon chipset, a revamped cooling system, and a display that’s buttery smooth, this phone is engineered for power users and mobile gamers. After weeks of testing, here’s our take.---### **Key Features Breakdown**1. **Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 + LPDDR5X RAM & UFS 4.0 Storage**:The iQOO 13 is powered by Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, paired with up to 16GB RAM and 512GB storage. This combo delivers blistering speeds for multitasking, app launches, and gaming. *Genshin Impact* and *Honkai: Star Rail* run at near-max settings with zero stutters, even during marathon sessions.2. **6.78-inch AMOLED Display (144Hz Refresh Rate)**:The 1.5K AMOLED screen is a visual treat, offering vibrant colors, deep blacks, and a buttery 144Hz refresh rate. HDR10+ support and 3,000 nits peak brightness make outdoor visibility stellar. Gamers will love the 2,000Hz instant touch sampling rate for ultra-responsive controls.3. **Dual Cryo-Vapor Cooling System**:iQOO’s upgraded cooling tech keeps thermals in check during intense gaming. Even after an hour of *PUBG Mobile*, the phone stays comfortably warm—not scalding—with no performance throttling.4. **120W Fast Charging + 5,500mAh Battery**:The 5,500mAh battery lasts a full day of heavy use (6-7 hours screen-on time). When drained, the 120W charger juices it up to 50% in **10 minutes** and 100% in **25 minutes**. Wireless charging is notably absent, though.5. **Triple Camera Setup (50MP + 50MP + 64MP)**:The main 50MP Sony IMX966 sensor captures crisp, dynamic shots in daylight. The 64MP 3x periscope telephoto lens is a standout for sharp zoom (up to 10x hybrid), while low-light performance is decent but not class-leading. The 50MP ultra-wide avoids distortion at the edges.6. **Funtouch OS 14 (Android 14)**:iQOO’s skin is cleaner than before but still includes bloatware. Gaming features like *Monster Mode* (unlocks full CPU/GPU power) and *4D Game Vibration* (haptic feedback synced to in-game actions) add immersion.---### **Performance & Experience**- **Gaming**: This is where the iQOO 13 shines. The combo of Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, 144Hz display, and touch sampling makes it a mobile gaming beast. Paired with accessories like the iQOO Cooler, it’s a legitimate portable console.- **Daily Use**: Apps fly open, and the UI feels snappy. The flat-edge design offers a premium grip, though the glossy back attracts fingerprints (opt for the vegan leather variant).- **Audio**: Stereo speakers are loud and clear, but audiophiles will miss a headphone jack.---### **Pros vs. Cons****Pros**:✅ Unmatched gaming performance with sustained thermal management.✅ Gorgeous 144Hz AMOLED display with best-in-class touch response.✅ Blazing 120W charging and solid battery life.✅ Versatile camera setup for a performance-focused phone.**Cons**:❌ No wireless charging or IP68 rating (expected at this price).❌ Funtouch OS still feels cluttered compared to stock Android.❌ Bulky at 209g—not ideal for one-handed use.---### **Final Verdict**The iQOO 13 isn’t just a phone; it’s a statement for gamers and power users who refuse to compromise. While it lacks polish in areas like software and premium durability features, its performance, display, and charging speed make it a top contender in the flagship arena.**Who should buy it?**- Mobile gamers craving desktop-level performance.- Users who prioritize charging speed and screen smoothness.- Photography enthusiasts who want a competent camera *and* a powerhouse chipset.**Rating**: 4.3/5 — A near-perfect performance machine held back by minor omissions.*Bottom Line*: If raw power and gaming dominance top your checklist, the iQOO 13 is a thrill ride worth the ticket. For everyone else, wait for a sale or consider more balanced flagships. 🎮⚡Read more; The iQOO 13 arrives as a no-compromise flagship, blending raw performance, gamer-centric optimizations, and sleek design into a device that aims to redefine the ""performance smartphone"" category.

I can see some dents on the box. It's not a good way to handle the package which has high value products inside. Very disappointed.; I bought this phone recently and because my previous phone was also based on exynos and it definitely had lower internet  and hotspot speed when compared even to cheaper phone of that time I was quite scared that the same thing will happen again. And sadly, my fears were right. The first thing I did was compare internet speed with my other phone and the speed was less than half of what was in other phone. These two times can't be a coincidence. I tried everything to accont for any error. I even exchanged the SIMs even though both were Jio, so that I am 100% sure.There is definitely some problem with exynos processor and internet speeds but I didn't know the drop would be less than half of what others are giving.Also there are genuine heating issues. Even for day to day task it would heat up. I knew about heating issues in Exynos but thought it was a premium flagship phone and my usage is quite light so it wouldn't make a difference. But, it did make a difference. Even on a 5-10 minues call it would heat up and become uncomfortable.Really feel cheated out of my money this time. I guess there is a reason they don't sell exynos in USA and China. Also there is  reason there was no exynos in S23 series and neither it is in S25.Once you buy the product can only be replaced and not returned, so you will be stuck with a smartphone where the most basic and the most critical function of a stable and fast internet itself is not there. Plus heating issues even on basic tasks will lead to throttling and slowing down ruining your experience.It is definitely not worth the money even on a huge discount which would be coming as I don't think otherwise anybody would buy it.The whole purpose of me writing this review (I generally don't review products) is to feel at least some sense of comfort that somebody else may not lose his/her money like I did, reading my review.If you want Samsung only - go for S23 series or S25 or S24 ultra but at all cost avoid Exynos processor. They are definitely, with multiple, and over the years, empirical evidence have significantly (not just slightly) poor and unstable internet speeds and really bad heating problems and it doesn't matter what is the pattern of your usage and these reviewers on youtube dont' tell us that.My Speed Test Data: On Snapdragon with Jio5G - Upto 140, always 100 Mbps + ; On Exynos with same SIM - Max 30-40 and on average 20-30, but the catch it is very unstable so a lot of time below 10 and even below 1.AVOID EXYNOS.

Do not expect wonders if you are planning to buy this phone. As the headline suggests, it is not for everyone.1. The build quality is good and the weight feels perfect as it is not on the heavier side. Since the weight distribution is good, it's easy to handle with one hand despite the screen size being close to ""massive"".2. The AMOLED screen works it's magic while watching videos. My primary aim to buy this phone was for viewing purpose since I spend a lot of time on YouTube and other streaming platforms. The color distribution is a chef's kiss since it does not try to forcibly add gradients. More on the natural side and hence the viewing experience will feel pleasant.3. Sound could have been better. The mono speakers feels cheap but yet surprisingly does the job. I use speakers and headphones so that it's that big of an issue for me (but if you depend on phone speakers for your entertainment, better look for another phone possibly POCO for stereo speakers at the same price point but then you will miss out on the display part )4. CHARGING ISSUE? The answer is NO, Although it's been just a day using this phone, i did not face any issues. I was skeptical after reading the reviews about the charging issues. It's true that I faced a little hiccup when i first charged the phone right after unboxing where the connection is interrupted during charger but that was just for a few seconds (Give it some time and the charging connection issue will disappear). Further the Hyper OS update completely rectified the issue.5. Refresh rate at 120Hz noticeably improves the social media experience. Brightness is good and you won't have any issues using the phone in sunlight. Switch to optimal settings for better using experience6. 5G works like a charm for me with JIO giving speeds of over 250 Mbps most of the time (Depends on the 5G zones. Some of you might get even better since stay near the outskirts of the city)7. Gaming: Not yet tested but it doesn't matter a lot to me so that's fine.8. Camera : Low light photos are good but make sure to stabilize your hand or else it would be blurry. 108 MP camera photos are good and provide good detailing. It could definitely have been a lot better but this phone is not for camera enthusiasts. If you like to create memories by clicking photos and not fuss about the details about them you can definitely go for it.Overall do not exclude this phone from your options (if you are planning on buying this) just by reading the negative reviews. I am not sure why there are so many negative reviews.

Especially from the performance aspect, the snapdragon 8s gen3 performs like a flagship beast giving stable 120 fps in COD mobile, bgmi and other demanding games. The phone sometimes heats up while charging or when 120 fps is unlocked but it isn't that big of deal, like it doesn't overheat and given the fps it provides the little heating is justified. The cameras are better than expected and the battery life is phenomenal, easily lasts 1.5-2 days on moderate usage. The display and haptics are top notch too.

Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi. And about CODM,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. Crazy good phone for CODM. For FC Mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. The lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. For codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed B in coastal S&D and 4 players were camping there. In FC Mobile no drops straight up 60. Crazy performance. The cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. So if you want natural photo than it's not good. Display is Crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. One more thing that is annoying is the UI, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. Good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy. Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.Read more; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi.

Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions. In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer.Read more; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of why this phone is an excellent choice:Design and Build Quality: The OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite boasts a sleek, modern design with a premium feel. The materials used are top-notch, giving it a solid and durable build. Its slim profile and lightweight nature make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.Display: The phone features a stunning AMOLED display with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. Whether watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, the visuals are crisp and clear. The high refresh rate adds to the smoothness of the experience, making every interaction buttery smooth.Performance: Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 SoC, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite handles everything with ease. From multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. While the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.Camera: The camera setup is impressive, especially the 50MP main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. The wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. The video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. However, low-light photography could use some improvement.Battery Life: Battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use. The 5,500mAh battery ensures you won’t run out of juice during the day. The fast charging feature is a lifesaver, allowing you to quickly top up the battery when needed.Additional Features: The phone has an official IP54 certification for protection against water splashes and dust. The design, inspired by minimalist tones and patterns, gives it a premium look. The 3.5mm audio jack is a bonus for wired earphone users.In conclusion, the OnePlus Nord CE 4 Lite is an excellent smartphone in its price segment. Its design, display, performance, and battery life make it a worthy contender. While it could benefit from a newer processor and improved low-light camera performance, it still offers great value for money.

With moderate usage on WiFi, can easily last upto 2 days. Also, there is very less battery drain when idle, especially overnight. Definitely one of the best with 6000 mAh. One of my primary reasons to buy this phone.- Camera quality at this price is way above average.- Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point.- One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations.- No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer.- Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.Cons:- Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g.- Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated.- Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage.- There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates.- Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram. Ultra wide camera, 50MB camera with Sony sensor and OIS. Super Amoled display and 6000 MaH battery. UI is also good. Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box?

Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center.

Before this I bought JioBharat Phone which is waste and now I have purchased this Phone.Registering JioPay was like a breeze. On the first attempt I am able to register my accounts. Making UPI at all the times was quick & easy and never failed.To my surprise it has WiFi & GPS also. If needed you can download Google Maps and works perfectly. It gives very nostalgia feeling. People are surprised to see making UPI payments in a feature phone.WhatsApp is not working and it says need an update. Battery drains fast and I mean it stands for a day. and not more than that. Hope any future software update from Jio could rectify this issue. Better to keep WiFi, GPS & Bluetooth OFF always to save Battery power as we do in Smart Phones.Will any if any in the coming days.Read more; This is a very good Phone.

I spoke with Amazon representative regarding the issue and they were quick enough to issue a replacement unit. I was skeptical about the replacement unit as well based on the already mentioned reviews but I am quite happy after receiving the new unit.I bought this for my mother, she was using the older jio phone. It's display was almost not visible and charging status was not showing. This felt like a good upgrade as I saw some reviews on YouTube mentioning this doesn't lag much like earlier phones.So I bought this and feels it is worth. Although its price seems a Lil over 300-800 more but I think from what it's offering, if you use all those features then it is a good deal, Although my mother uses the phone mostly to call and now to video call sometimes. Battery is pretty good for such usage and it lasted almost 3 days with minimal to moderate usage which is very good.I watched youtube videos, live match in jio cinema, played some music in Jio Saavn and also that wireless radio feature is a very good addition, there isn't much lag considering its size and form factor, I liked the video plaback quality and sound, it is good enough.Saw so much of negative reviews for this one, may be some products are defective like the first one which I received but felt this doesn't deserve that.

While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.Update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.Read more; First impressions:1. While it has a LCD display.

With moderate usage on WiFi, can easily last upto 2 days. Also, there is very less battery drain when idle, especially overnight. Definitely one of the best with 6000 mAh. One of my primary reasons to buy this phone.- Camera quality at this price is way above average.- Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point.- One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations.- No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer.- Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.Cons:- Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g.- Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated.- Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage.- There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates.- Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center.

And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.; ProsDisplay is very impressive, Samsung one UI is very good and useful.

I don't play games.- Worst front facing camera I used. And I have always used budget phones.+ Back camera is average. Didn't use it much though.- I do miss stereo speakers during video calls or music playing. (I also have Realme P1 as a primary)+ Battery is also average. Not great not worst.- No charger. Seriously. And charge time is just insanely high for a 5000mah Battery.+ OneUI is great.- Bloatware install during setup and hidden settings is not great.- Only 3 fingerprints can be added. More would have been nice.- UFS 2.2 storage is slow and not at all worth it. App installation is going to take more time than downloading it.Suggestions :> Use light theme throughout the day.> Disable unwanted apps.> If you use it yourself or give this to your parents or any one, please disable glance and disable any bloatware you don't want.> F16 was launched a bit cheaper than this one.

But it's not for these Gen z kids, UI and software is simple and clean. Not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.Phone is heating as common as other phones.Battery life average for 5000mahValue for money; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time.

Especially from the performance aspect, the snapdragon 8s gen3 performs like a flagship beast giving stable 120 fps in COD mobile, bgmi and other demanding games.

The cameras are better than expected and the battery life is phenomenal, easily lasts 1.5-2 days on moderate usage. The display and haptics are top notch too.

Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi. And about CODM,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. Crazy good phone for CODM. For FC Mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. The lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. For codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed B in coastal S&D and 4 players were camping there. In FC Mobile no drops straight up 60. Crazy performance. The cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. So if you want natural photo than it's not good. Display is Crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. One more thing that is annoying is the UI, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. Good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy. Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.Read more; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi.

Display is Crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. One more thing that is annoying is the UI, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. Good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy. Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions. In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer.Read more; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions.

And the video quality is the one which surprised me the most it's actually really not iPhone level but up there, really good video zoom just use pro mode if you want to pull out the most details keep it around 500 ISO AND EVERYTHING AUTO, video in night auto mode is good but it does have some grains in it. Battery life if good if you play bgmi, you will probably get 6 hours I play with smooth 90fps and 4x anti aliasing and don't use frame interpolation there is slight delay in gyro but does make it smoother but not recommended. Battery is good few games and camera ussage will probably get you 6+ hours and light usage will get 8 hours +. Charging takes 35 min to full charge. I haven't updated my phone since July, if you're in July patch then don't update that's the best update I've had and tested for performance and camera quality and would not recommend updating your phone as all other companies it might slow down if you want to update then look it up first then decide if you want update the software but wouldn't recommend only if the banking or other apps need the latest firmware the you need to update or you can go to the service centre and ask them to downgrade.

While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.Update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.Read more; First impressions:1. While it has a LCD display.

The first thing I noticed was the weight—it feels surprisingly light despite housing a large 5500 mAh battery, which is impressive for long-lasting power without adding bulk. The phone is slim, comfortable to hold, and fits well in the hand, making it ideal for daily use.The camera quality is good for standard photos but has limitations. While it handles basic shots decently, the wide-angle video quality falls short, and there’s no 60 fps option in 4K, which could be a drawback for those who love detailed video work. Additionally, I noticed the camera app tends to lag or even get stuck after taking multiple portrait-mode shots, which disrupts the experience a bit.Overall, it's a solid budget option with good design, reasonable performance, and decent battery life, though the camera could use a few software improvements for smoother functionality.Read more; After using this phone for a month, I can say it's a great choice, especially for the price.

First I need to use it and under rigorous testing only I can put forward my verdict so that any brother or  sister can buy the same from Amazon.BODY : OnePlus has comeup with a very durable body and stylish. Looking premium.DISPLAY: Its a PureAmoled with 10Bit resolution with crispy HDR10 features. Vibrant natural color and screen ratio is 88.5% to body ratio. So very less bezels.BATTERY: Easily comes for 1 and half day if not playing any games. With games 1 day. No idle midnight auto battery drain and all. 5500mAh is very slowly discharging and due to 100w charger coming inside the box the mobile charges in 17 to 18minutes only upto 85% and full 100% charging approx 19 minutes as per my test.CAMERA: Very ok for the price. I got one update recently in May 25, 2024 and after this the camera works wonderful specially selfie and portrait mode.PROCESSOR: Snapdragon 7Gen3 name is enough that it is very stable and fast multi tasking and even this snapdragon version not heats up fastly.  The clock speed is amazingly impressive to any games like PUBG or FreeFires or Asphalt. Rest all the medium games runs smoothly. No throttle. No lag and even No uncommon heating issues etc.METWORK: Very fast 5G and even 4G also no issues. Runs smoothly without any call drop or any disturbance in voice quality. The Voice Focus mode works very nice even in the rush or crowded metro area. Last time recorded download speed was 175mbps & upload speed approx 145 to 166mbps.STEREO SPEAKERS: This is what attracted me the most. The stereo speakers are very loud enough. And even it sync the eaarpods very quickly. OnePlus earpods are recommended for all those EQ and bass.OVERALL VERDICT:  Very lightest mobile inspite of 5500 mAh battery. Too premium boxy design. Call and network speed very impressive. After investing on this phone I have not regretted. Highly recommended and Value for money. Thanks Seller and Amazon. 100w charger in the box. Backcase and screen guard all in the box. A complete midrange killer phone. Highly valuable.Read more; I usually not write ✍️ review very fast when it comes to smartphone.

So, need to shell out extra money for these.Read more; Pros:- Great battery backup. With moderate usage on WiFi, can easily last upto 2 days. Also, there is very less battery drain when idle, especially overnight. Definitely one of the best with 6000 mAh. One of my primary reasons to buy this phone.- Camera quality at this price is way above average.- Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point.- One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations.- No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer.- Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones.

So, need to shell out extra money for these.; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations. The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram. Ultra wide camera, 50MB camera with Sony sensor and OIS. Super Amoled display and 6000 MaH battery. UI is also good. Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.Read more; I have searched lot of phones in this price range, no one giving you all in one phone. Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram.

Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center.

Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.….. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experienceRead more; Just made the transition and here’s my POV on the first ~2 month of usePros- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious?

Especially from the performance aspect, the snapdragon 8s gen3 performs like a flagship beast giving stable 120 fps in COD mobile, bgmi and other demanding games. The phone sometimes heats up while charging or when 120 fps is unlocked but it isn't that big of deal, like it doesn't overheat and given the fps it provides the little heating is justified. The cameras are better than expected and the battery life is phenomenal, easily lasts 1.5-2 days on moderate usage. The display and haptics are top notch too. Just funtouch os needs some refinement which I hope will be solved with future updates. Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍Read more; Good phone all in all.

Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi. And about CODM,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. Crazy good phone for CODM. For FC Mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. The lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. For codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed B in coastal S&D and 4 players were camping there. In FC Mobile no drops straight up 60. Crazy performance. The cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. So if you want natural photo than it's not good. Display is Crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. One more thing that is annoying is the UI, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. Good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy. Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.Read more; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi.

Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions. In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer.Read more; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions.

The device delivers a seamless gaming experience that enhances the overall satisfaction of owning this flagship phone.Overall, I consider the iQOO 12 a great purchase, especially for those looking for an exceptional gaming, multimedia, and camera experience within a budget of 50k. While there might be some software experience quirks, the device's performance in gaming, multimedia consumption, and photography make it a worthy investment that won't leave you disappointed. If you're in the market for a feature-packed smartphone, the iQOO 12 is a solid choice 💯😊😊Read more; I recently caught wind of iQOO's latest flagship release, the iQOO 12, and after extensive research, I took the plunge and purchased this device just two days ago. Let me share my experience with you.First and foremost, the camera setup on the iQOO 12 is nothing short of remarkable. Boasting a triple camera configuration of 50+50+64MP, the pictures captured are not only vivid but also showcase a unique and distinctive style that sets it apart from other iQOO models. Even compared to my sister's more expensive phone, the iQOO 12 outshines with its superior camera quality. I am genuinely delighted and satisfied with the camera performance.The design of the iQOO 12 is another standout feature. The metal sides give it a premium feel, and the device's grip is both comfortable and secure. The impressive build quality is evident, making it a pleasure to hold and use.The user interface is clean and intuitive, contributing to an overall positive user experience. Navigating through the device is a breeze, adding to my satisfaction with the iQOO 12.In terms of battery life, I am pleased with the performance so far. Although the charging time is approximately 25 minutes for a full charge, the endurance of the battery makes it bearable, as I don't find myself needing to charge frequently. A small trade-off for extended usage.Gaming on the iQOO 12 is a delight.

If you're in the market for a feature-packed smartphone, the iQOO 12 is a solid choice 💯😊😊; The media could not be loaded.It's been 5m since I bought this phone had a great experience, switched from iqoo neo 6 and this upgrade is worth it if you want best performance and overall good camera, the photos are really good as it's vivo's sub brand so the image pipeline is really good just vibrant on some occasions but you will not be disappointed. And the video quality is the one which surprised me the most it's actually really not iPhone level but up there, really good video zoom just use pro mode if you want to pull out the most details keep it around 500 ISO AND EVERYTHING AUTO, video in night auto mode is good but it does have some grains in it. Battery life if good if you play bgmi, you will probably get 6 hours I play with smooth 90fps and 4x anti aliasing and don't use frame interpolation there is slight delay in gyro but does make it smoother but not recommended. Battery is good few games and camera ussage will probably get you 6+ hours and light usage will get 8 hours +. Charging takes 35 min to full charge. I haven't updated my phone since July, if you're in July patch then don't update that's the best update I've had and tested for performance and camera quality and would not recommend updating your phone as all other companies it might slow down if you want to update then look it up first then decide if you want update the software but wouldn't recommend only if the banking or other apps need the latest firmware the you need to update or you can go to the service centre and ask them to downgrade. ( I hope vivo and iqoo bring custom rom support because that would be great to have like poco and oneplus ).Pros* Good camera for the price could be bit better in video.* One of the best gaming phones does heat up but in a controlled way and cools down pretty fast.* Really Fast charging speed ( does heat a bit nothing to bother or just open settings - battery - charging and disable fast charging it will slightly slow down charging speed but it will decrease phone's surface temp ).* Good display very bright overall really goodscreen.* Very good after sale service ( disclaimer had experience with previous phone iqoo Neo 6 regarding screen replacement bit pricey but really good experience and very fast.Cons* Mediocre Selfie camera my old IQoo Neo 6 had better selfie's than this paid 55k for a phone and no 4k Selfie video front is the biggest downside of this phone.* UI is good very reliable but not as good as other Android Skins ( Just updated to android 15 did make a way better and smoother but could be better).* And audio transmitter has kinda bad the output is not upto to the mark with bluetooh specifically had same problem with my Neo 6 my poco f1 had really good audio Dec on board than this two new phones.Overall - 4.4/5This is rating is based on my experience, and also to point out I'm very heavy user, so the fact that it is able to keep up with demands is actually very commendable, And a brief disclaimer I am a long term iqoo user been using iqoo brand since 2022 but overall the phone is really good and has impressed me. That's the reason I'm taking my time and giving a review here.Quick updateAnd BTW regarding updating your phone I still stand by NOT UPDATING YOUR PHONE, but I have updated to android 15 I did reasearch thoroughly and decided update because there were a lot improvement and I don't plan on updating after this update ( So the phone is on android 15 Nov security patch ).Read more; The media could not be loaded.It's been 5m since I bought this phone had a great experience, switched from iqoo neo 6 and this upgrade is worth it if you want best performance and overall good camera, the photos are really good as it's vivo's sub brand so the image pipeline is really good just vibrant on some occasions but you will not be disappointed.

I am not a big fan of Realme but used their mobiles in past such as Realme 5 Pro, Realme X etc, was heard a lot and interested for GT 2 Pro but skipped that due to heating issues (Obviously because of Qualcomm), these Mobiles lasted for years which proves quality hardware realme produces.I am fan of Oneplus and used Oneplus 11 and using  Pixel 7 pro, Oneplus 12, S24 Ultra. Morevour, I used Iphone pro max for years.Why I am adding these, because it makes sense to differentiate and add Genuine feedback after handling multiple Brand's Mobiles and different Softwares.Let me start with Screen Size first, Gt7 Pro isn't having big screen like OnePlus 12 and S24 Ultra but I see that Realme balanced Screen Size perfectly, not much big or small, easy to handle using single hand unlike Oneplus 12 or S24 Ultra.Screen quality and colors are too good, not punchy and too vibrant like samsung but again balanced.Snapdragon Elite processor seems well optimised and doesn't feel heating while playing games. Realme will definitely optimize it more in coming days as its a new processor (This applies for all the Brands).5G speed is good.Realme uses the almost similar software as Oneplus (Very difficult to differentiate) thanks to the parent company Oppo.

Got the Golden yellow colour and thankfully it's not as flashy as shown in the photos.. this is more of a light cream colour which gives a slight golden shine when seen at particular angles. It's a very decent looking phone.When you use it, the first thing you  notice is that this phone really heats up. It's Samsungs flagship and the heating issue is not limited to just while charging it, even when you use it normally.. the back gets hot. Never faced this with the S20. I feel like am using some cheap Chinese phone...well it won't burn your ear, but yes it's hot enough for one to take note.>>And now after a few more days of usage, the heating issue has disappeared. Even after hours of continuous use it doesn't heat up... not sure what happened.. perhaps some software update.Second is the design. Samsung used to have it's own design team which came up with really innovative stuff.. now they are just copying the iPhone. It literally looks like a Chinese knock off, OK let's give them credit.. it looks like a cheap Korean knock off of the iPhone. Nothing wrong with that, except that if you want to copy then copy something good. Personally the flat edged design is terrible to grasp and feels rigid in the palm. The earlier curved edge ones were so much comfortable to hold. Now you have to hold on to this flat metal frame which heats up.. it's not a pleasant experience. Perhaps they made this for cold weather countries, so you get an inbuilt palm heater with your phone. A phone that keeps your hands warm while in the cold... heaven knows what the designers were thinking!>> Well as I said before the heating issue has gone. As for the shape, I would say it's easier to handle having those flat edges.. it rests easily on the figers while typing etc.. but still you do feel the flat edges when the phone is in your pocket etc.. So the shape is a mixed bag verdict. Personally I prefer smoother edges.The battery drains out fast aswell..  currently it's matching the drainage speed of my old Samsung. Basically you have to have a fast charger around.>> This is the point why I actually decided to edit the review. The phone's software literally optmises battery usage. It continuously adjusts screen brightness levels.. and with time and use, it's getting better at optimising battery performance. For regular usage, with a few hrs of videos and few hrs of games.. it's pulling through the day quiet easily.Honestly I don't know why this phone should cost so much.. for the issues it has, you should easily get a similar cheaper phone in the 20-25k range.>> Doubt it, this phone keeps getting better with usage. Never expected or experienced that before.Camera haven't yet used. My old S20 used to give some amazing results and have used it a lot with manual settings aswell. Wonder if the S24 will be better there.I think I might switch back to the S20.>> Camera still not used to potential. Basic shots are very crisp though.The AI functions are also quiet handy.

Even after hours of continuous use it doesn't heat up... not sure what happened.. perhaps some software update.Second is the design. Samsung used to have it's own design team which came up with really innovative stuff.. now they are just copying the iPhone. It literally looks like a Chinese knock off, OK let's give them credit.. it looks like a cheap Korean knock off of the iPhone. Nothing wrong with that, except that if you want to copy then copy something good. Personally the flat edged design is terrible to grasp and feels rigid in the palm. The earlier curved edge ones were so much comfortable to hold. Now you have to hold on to this flat metal frame which heats up.. it's not a pleasant experience. Perhaps they made this for cold weather countries, so you get an inbuilt palm heater with your phone. A phone that keeps your hands warm while in the cold... heaven knows what the designers were thinking!>> Well as I said before the heating issue has gone. As for the shape, I would say it's easier to handle having those flat edges.. it rests easily on the figers while typing etc.. but still you do feel the flat edges when the phone is in your pocket etc.. So the shape is a mixed bag verdict. Personally I prefer smoother edges.The battery drains out fast aswell..  currently it's matching the drainage speed of my old Samsung. Basically you have to have a fast charger around.>> This is the point why I actually decided to edit the review. The phone's software literally optmises battery usage. It continuously adjusts screen brightness levels.. and with time and use, it's getting better at optimising battery performance. For regular usage, with a few hrs of videos and few hrs of games.. it's pulling through the day quiet easily.Honestly I don't know why this phone should cost so much.. for the issues it has, you should easily get a similar cheaper phone in the 20-25k range.>> Doubt it, this phone keeps getting better with usage. Never expected or experienced that before.Camera haven't yet used. My old S20 used to give some amazing results and have used it a lot with manual settings aswell. Wonder if the S24 will be better there.I think I might switch back to the S20.>> Camera still not used to potential. Basic shots are very crisp though.The AI functions are also quiet handy. Just played around till now.. so hopefully like the other aspects will get better with time.🤞; I have been using this phone for a month now and the Samsung Galaxy S24 is a very good phone. If you are someone who is looking to buy a phone in this price range then you probably have the Iphone 15, Pixel 8 series as an alternative option but I would say the Samsung phone experience is the best of the three unless you are into the Apple ecosystem or you want to buy and IPhone cuz it's an IPhone (It's just crazy that many people make decisions like that 😂).Jokes apart, I would say at this price this is probably the best phone in terms of the display, software experience and overall features. The performance is also very good, there are many people who are skeptical about the Exynos chips which is obviously unfair from Samsung to have two versions of the same phone but at least this time the chip is very good and almost as powerful as the SD 8 Gen 3. Yes it is 10-15% less powerful in the CPU department from benchmarks but honestly theses flagship chipsets are so powerful that 90% of the people are not even going to notice the slight difference. I tried playing COD on this phone at max possible settings for 1 hour and the phone was hot but not any more hot than any other phone would get. Yes it did drop the battery which I will get to later but I don't think raw performance is an issue with the Exynos chips this time as the Exynos chips is actually more powerful that the SD 8 Gen 3 in the GPU department. Now coming to the battery this is the only place I am a little disappointed with this phone like if you are a light user who only uses their phone for calls, messages, music on bluetooth you can make the phone work for an entire day but if you are a medium or a heavy user like if you play games, take pictures, videos etc you will definetly drain the battery before the end of the day. In my experience I am a fairly heavy user using bluetooth, mobile hotspot, playing a few light games I always need to charge the phone at around 5 pm. But this is a sacrifice you have to make if you are getting a small phone, now if you are thinking that the IPhone 15 is also a small phone but it has better battery life then that is because the IPhone 15 only has a 60hz display which isen't as smooth the 120hz on all the phones these days and also does not consume a lot of battery like a 120hz display would. I am not that big of a camera bluff so I won't talk about it just want to say that it is a good camera with sharp pictures with good looking colors and camera features (Checkout the images attached). The video is also very good.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S24 emerges as an impressive smartphone, overshadowing debates about Exynos chip performance differences. Its overall performance, combined with its compact size, makes it a compelling choice for users seeking a premium smartphone experience.Read more; I have been using this phone for a month now and the Samsung Galaxy S24 is a very good phone.

I spoke with Amazon representative regarding the issue and they were quick enough to issue a replacement unit. I was skeptical about the replacement unit as well based on the already mentioned reviews but I am quite happy after receiving the new unit.I bought this for my mother, she was using the older jio phone. It's display was almost not visible and charging status was not showing. This felt like a good upgrade as I saw some reviews on YouTube mentioning this doesn't lag much like earlier phones.So I bought this and feels it is worth. Although its price seems a Lil over 300-800 more but I think from what it's offering, if you use all those features then it is a good deal, Although my mother uses the phone mostly to call and now to video call sometimes. Battery is pretty good for such usage and it lasted almost 3 days with minimal to moderate usage which is very good.I watched youtube videos, live match in jio cinema, played some music in Jio Saavn and also that wireless radio feature is a very good addition, there isn't much lag considering its size and form factor, I liked the video plaback quality and sound, it is good enough.Saw so much of negative reviews for this one, may be some products are defective like the first one which I received but felt this doesn't deserve that.

Charging taking more and more time than stated by company. Mobile overheating,Accidental touch (pocket mode not working) problem.Waiting for android 13 from 8 months.Major problem:: No updates no security updates. Company sold mobiles and forgot . Totally waste of money; I am writing this review taking into account its price with exchange. I bought two units - one at around Rs. 24000 and the other one at around Rs. 13000 both with exchange.At this price, no phone can defeat this .Build : sturdy built quality with metal frame and victus protection with military grade certification.Design : On paper, camera module looks a little odd but in reality, it looks fantastic and very premium.Display : very good curved display with great colour reproduction.Battery : regularly get 1 & half days of battery backup with screen on time more than 7 hours. I am not a gamer but I am a heavy user.Performance: Don't need to say anything because it has Dimensity 9000, last year flagship.Software: haven't found any issue yet.Camera : According to price, I can say camera quality is very good both in day and night. It has so many features. I really like Skyshop feature, cinematic video, background blur video etc.Only con I can find is the lack of stereo speakers. In some scenerios, sound seems low.I think this is the most value for money phone if you have a phone to exchange.Read more; I am writing this review taking into account its price with exchange.

But it's not for these Gen z kids, UI and software is simple and clean. Not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.Phone is heating as common as other phones.Battery life average for 5000mahValue for money; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time.

But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.Cons:- Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g.- Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated.- Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage.- There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates.- Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram. Ultra wide camera, 50MB camera with Sony sensor and OIS. Super Amoled display and 6000 MaH battery. UI is also good. Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.Read more; I have searched lot of phones in this price range, no one giving you all in one phone. Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram.

Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center.

Fingerprints read all the time and ultra fast without screenguard, as samsung fingerprint reads are different to that of say, oneplus!; Booked my 12+512gb version as soon as it was launched. And after using it for more than a month, here's my review.Pros1) exceptional camera quality. The 12MP ultra-wide does it's job and I would say going for 5x optical zoom with 50MP sensor instead for 10x 10MP sensor is a better choice as upto 30x I would say the pictures are more crisp than S23 ultra.2) Build quality is premium. It feels like a high budget smartphone. Not sure if titanium armor is enough to withstand high drop possibilities, but it does make it lighter.3) Screen is a big improvement. The anti reflective Corning Gorilla glass armor does it's job and reflects most of the glare so you can sit easily and watch without worrying if the person sitting next to you is watching coz they can't. 😁3) S-pen has improved a bit. A lot of people are saying that they don't use it much after first time, but that's not the case with me. If you will get the hang of it, you will use it quite often.4) AI interface is quite excellent. Although in initial phase, it does it's job in notes and summarising big pages so that you can easily get the gist.5) 7 years OS and security update is a big big up from my side.6) The box like built rather than a curve display is a better choice. It's easier to find a screen protector.7) sanpdragan 8 gen3 is fast. You can play high end games at maximum capacity. Android 14 with one UI 6 is smooth as you can hope it would be. I haven't recorded any lags or heating issues as for now.Cons1) Anti refective display works until you put  the above mention screen protector. After that it won't work with that precision. Although it still does it's job.2) Selfie camera is still not that great if you're using iPhone 14 or 15 pro.3) generative AI is not that great in calls and photo editing. Also, to pay for these services after 2025 is a big drawback from Samsung.4) Samsung is still not implementing faster charging protocols on their high and mid range smartphones. In a time when OnePlus is offering 100W charging speeds and xiomi offering 50-80W wireless charging, Samsung is still stuck with 45W and 15W wireless charging. Big drawback. However, battery do last for a full day.5) speaking of charging, no charger included is a serious letdown when you're spending more than a lac on a high end smartphone. Samsung, it doesn't feels good. 😔Overall, a good smartphone if you're thinking to go for a big one for a long time.Read more; Booked my 12+512gb version as soon as it was launched.

Lasts 2 days with mild usage.5. Call Quality. Despite having a single mic, call quality is good.6. Camera. Though it lacked few advanced features like slow motion recording, 4K 60 fps recording, still camera quality is good. Captures very good shots in day light but looses a bit of details in low light but still good enough. 3x zoom also a good feature. Selfie camera is also satisfactory.Didn't like,1. Speaker. I was using Redmi Note7 Pro for last 6 years and was expecting similar sound quality. Its a single speaker setup and sound is not that deep like of Note7 Pro.2. Build. Its a bit bulky. If you have short hand than you will struggle to use it with a single hand.Overall good phone. Want Pro features than go for Note Pro.Read more; It's been a month using this phone.

But it's not for these Gen z kids, UI and software is simple and clean. Not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.Phone is heating as common as other phones.Battery life average for 5000mahValue for money; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time.

While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.Update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. A capable set of speakers.

One of my primary reasons to buy this phone.- Camera quality at this price is way above average.- Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point.- One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations.- No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer.- Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.Cons:- Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g.- Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated.- Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage.- There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates.- Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram. Ultra wide camera, 50MB camera with Sony sensor and OIS. Super Amoled display and 6000 MaH battery. UI is also good. Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box?

Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center.

Especially from the performance aspect, the snapdragon 8s gen3 performs like a flagship beast giving stable 120 fps in COD mobile, bgmi and other demanding games. The phone sometimes heats up while charging or when 120 fps is unlocked but it isn't that big of deal, like it doesn't overheat and given the fps it provides the little heating is justified. The cameras are better than expected and the battery life is phenomenal, easily lasts 1.5-2 days on moderate usage. The display and haptics are top notch too. Just funtouch os needs some refinement which I hope will be solved with future updates. Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍Read more; Good phone all in all.

Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi. And about CODM,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. Crazy good phone for CODM. For FC Mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. The lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. For codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed B in coastal S&D and 4 players were camping there. In FC Mobile no drops straight up 60. Crazy performance. The cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. So if you want natural photo than it's not good. Display is Crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. One more thing that is annoying is the UI, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. Good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy. Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.Read more; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi.

Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions. In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer.Read more; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions.

Reminds of HTC phones who were known for their shear build quality- Curved screen is just gorgeous. Ability to keep the tones natural colors or make it look vibrant, like Samsung devices- Has FM radio which is rare nowadays (regardless of we using it or not, its a plus)- Camera is pretty impressive during the day, both Back and Front.

Looks very similar to MIUI- Even though its a mono speaker system, the sound quality felt decent. Probably optimised for vocals- Comes with a screenguard on but the placement of the screenguard is not precisePotential Con's- Loads of bloatware apps. Few of which cant be removed.

The moment he saw it, he was blown away by the design—it’s so different from the usual phones flooding the market. The Nothing Phone truly has its own identity, especially with that eye-catching Glyph backlighting system. Those LED strips on the back light up in cool patterns, and it’s something you won’t find anywhere else. It’s safe to say this phone has carved out its own unique spot in the smartphone world.Performance-wise, the phone runs smoothly and handles light gaming like a champ, thanks to its MediaTek Dimensity 7200 Pro processor and Mali-G610 GPU. My nephew enjoys playing his favorite games, and it keeps up without any hiccups. What I really appreciate, though, is the Nothing OS system UI. It’s perfectly designed with a unique grayscale display that’s not as flashy or colorful as other Android interfaces. This subtle touch seems intentional—it doesn’t pull you in to overuse the phone, which is great for my nephew. It’s refreshing to see a company like Nothing think about how design can influence usage habits in a positive way.The camera, I’ll admit, is a bit disappointing. It’s got a dual 50MP setup on the back and a 32MP front camera, but the quality isn’t top-tier. That said, my nephew doesn’t mind one bit—he’s just snapping pics of his toys and random stuff around the house, so it’s more than good enough for him. If you’re a photography buff, this might not be your pick, but for casual use, it gets the job done.Overall, I’m thrilled with this purchase! The Nothing Phone 2a 5G brings a fresh vibe with its standout design and thoughtful features. The package even came with a unique Type-C charging cable with transparent connectors—such a cool touch—and a sleek, matching SIM ejector that my nephew thought was “super fancy.” The only downside? No charging adapter in the box, which was a bummer. I wish companies would still include a charging brick, but it’s a small hiccup in an otherwise awesome experience. For anyone looking for something different and fun, this phone’s a winner!Read more; I recently bought the Nothing Phone 2a 5G from Amazon for my nephew, and I have to say, it’s been a hit with him!

Sound is good with the dolby Atmos stereo but should have been louder, at the first it was heating but after completing updates it is always bone cold even in warzone at maximum settings (game that overheats samsung and apple phones) the white colour looks so good, and the curved side and curved back feels so good to hold and ergonomic. Never faced accidental touch, i hate holding flat sharp phones. This just feels smooth. Weight is definitely on high side but it's width saves it from feeling like a brick, and as I mentioned curved sides help too.At the end it is a great flagship, and easily value for money, as at this price it is being compared to 1L+ phones and not to the phones of same price.

It would have been better if they had given ip68 that would have made it more complete; This was my return to OnePlus brand in 5 years after OnePlus 7. Previously I was using Samsung Galaxy S22+ for 2 years. My initial experience was great, but after a few months, I started to feel the phone's performance getting hit, which was a shock as Samsung promised 5 years of OS updates and it got a degraded performance just in a few month's time. Also, the phone was heating up pretty badly even with a short span of gaming and drained the battery. Then I decided to switch ASAP as the Amazon GIF was about to start and picked the Glacial white colour and looks luxurious. Also got the OnePlus Buds pro 2 worth 9k totally free.To begin with, I was a bit confused to purchase OnePlus phone with all the green lines & motherboard fiasco. After a heavy research, I convinced myself to purchase the phone. Till now the phone has been performing great and I am happy. My experience is drafted as pointers below:1. Size of the phone - Yes, it is a big & heavy phone an might need some tine to get used to it. I have big hands and I felt convenient holding it. The camera module is a bit bulky, but this issue got resolved after I slapped on a Ringke case.2. Performance - After purchasing, you have to give it a few days to adjust to your daily routines, charging habits etc. an you will notice some mild heating with some jitters in the UI. But after that the phone is now buttery smooth and I just love the way the animations work. Only time you can feel some heat is during the camera use and charging. I play PES 2025 occasionally and it was smooth.3. Cameras - Yes, Samsung did have a great set of cameras, but got degraded with updates. As of now OnePlus 12 takes good photos. The macro& portrait shots are excellent. Hope they keep improving on this. Videos are also good enough. Selfie camera here is still not upto the mark & Samsung wins in the selfie section.4. Battery & Charging - This department really takes my breath away. My battery anxiety has gone down now. I easily get more than 7hrs of SOT & 100W charger is extremely fast and saves my time. Samsung literally lost in this department face down.5. Screen - It's a 2k OLED curved screen manufactured by BOE that is bright enough with 1600 Nits of HBM. I could easily read under direct sunlight and the LTPO display with the adaptive refresh rate works like a charm. This is my first curved screen experience and still getting used to it, but does look premium.6. Build quality - The phone is sturdy with Gorilla glass victus 2 in from & gorilla glass in the back. It holds firmly in your hands, but us a case as it is slippery.7. OS - One UI is really good, loaded with features. Oxygen OS is now Color OS and has lost it's Oxygen OS feel. But the OS is lighter than One UI which makes the SD8gen3 chipset snappier. It also has a few tricks up its sleeve and is very handy. (P.S. - Happy to see the 3 fingers screenshot, as Samsung did miss this.)Some cons that I noticed:1. They could have give IP68 at this price.2. The cameral initially seems a bit off, but once you get used to its working mode, zoom style etc., then it will be fine.3. Since I come from Samsung, I feel that some features in Samsung could have been implemented here also (like modes & routines, AI image editor).4. Since the Greenline issues & motherboard issue persists in almost all phone brands, better take in the extended warranty at Rs 999.5. Getting a screen protector is still a challenge. I have installed a skin to avoid scratches.The buds are also working fine and has a great audio signature.Hopefully this phone lasts for me well. Will keep you all posted in case of any updates. (I am using the Ringke Camo back cover which sits perfectly with the phone, just FYI)Thank you!Update on 14 Oct 2024 - The phone is still performing well and the battery life is remarkable. For people looking for a good case, please select the Ringke case for Oneplus 12 as it has a better screen protection and holding grip. I took the camouflage version as it's back is not a fingerprint magnet.Thank you.Read more; This was my return to OnePlus brand in 5 years after OnePlus 7. Previously I was using Samsung Galaxy S22+ for 2 years. My initial experience was great, but after a few months, I started to feel the phone's performance getting hit, which was a shock as Samsung promised 5 years of OS updates and it got a degraded performance just in a few month's time. Also, the phone was heating up pretty badly even with a short span of gaming and drained the battery. Then I decided to switch ASAP as the Amazon GIF was about to start and picked the Glacial white colour and looks luxurious. Also got the OnePlus Buds pro 2 worth 9k totally free.To begin with, I was a bit confused to purchase OnePlus phone with all the green lines & motherboard fiasco. After a heavy research, I convinced myself to purchase the phone. Till now the phone has been performing great and I am happy. My experience is drafted as pointers below:1. Size of the phone - Yes, it is a big & heavy phone an might need some tine to get used to it. I have big hands and I felt convenient holding it. The camera module is a bit bulky, but this issue got resolved after I slapped on a Ringke case.2. Performance - After purchasing, you have to give it a few days to adjust to your daily routines, charging habits etc. an you will notice some mild heating with some jitters in the UI. But after that the phone is now buttery smooth and I just love the way the animations work. Only time you can feel some heat is during the camera use and charging. I play PES 2025 occasionally and it was smooth.3. Cameras - Yes, Samsung did have a great set of cameras, but got degraded with updates. As of now OnePlus 12 takes good photos. The macro& portrait shots are excellent. Hope they keep improving on this. Videos are also good enough. Selfie camera here is still not upto the mark & Samsung wins in the selfie section.4. Battery & Charging - This department really takes my breath away. My battery anxiety has gone down now. I easily get more than 7hrs of SOT & 100W charger is extremely fast and saves my time. Samsung literally lost in this department face down.5. Screen - It's a 2k OLED curved screen manufactured by BOE that is bright enough with 1600 Nits of HBM. I could easily read under direct sunlight and the LTPO display with the adaptive refresh rate works like a charm. This is my first curved screen experience and still getting used to it, but does look premium.6. Build quality - The phone is sturdy with Gorilla glass victus 2 in from & gorilla glass in the back. It holds firmly in your hands, but us a case as it is slippery.7. OS - One UI is really good, loaded with features. Oxygen OS is now Color OS and has lost it's Oxygen OS feel.

I was thinking of buying iPhone, 13, 14 or 15 for a change. However, when I read the reviews of phone I found out people who were ios users earlier are buying one plus 12 and they are extremely happy about their decision. The camera is amazing! It's super fast charging is one of the best feature which stands apart from other competitor phones. Display is the best and value for money phone . Doesn't have heating problem and runs with smoothness even while playing big games.  Only thing I wish is that this phone has IP 67 or 68 rating. Let's hope it will work on it after sometime!  Thank you one plus for this amazing phone.Read more; Was using one plus 2, One plus 7 and now bought one plus 12 on June 7th. Must say, this is one of the best phones.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram. Ultra wide camera, 50MB camera with Sony sensor and OIS. Super Amoled display and 6000 MaH battery. UI is also good. Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.Read more; I have searched lot of phones in this price range, no one giving you all in one phone. Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram.

Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center.

Especially from the performance aspect, the snapdragon 8s gen3 performs like a flagship beast giving stable 120 fps in COD mobile, bgmi and other demanding games. The phone sometimes heats up while charging or when 120 fps is unlocked but it isn't that big of deal, like it doesn't overheat and given the fps it provides the little heating is justified. The cameras are better than expected and the battery life is phenomenal, easily lasts 1.5-2 days on moderate usage. The display and haptics are top notch too. Just funtouch os needs some refinement which I hope will be solved with future updates. Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍Read more; Good phone all in all.

Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi. And about CODM,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. Crazy good phone for CODM. For FC Mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. The lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. For codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed B in coastal S&D and 4 players were camping there. In FC Mobile no drops straight up 60. Crazy performance. The cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. So if you want natural photo than it's not good. Display is Crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. One more thing that is annoying is the UI, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. Good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy. Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.Read more; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi.

Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions. In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer.Read more; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions.

There is absolutely no heating issue. Touch quality is smooth. One crutial thing that Lava needs to work on is the camera. They have provided the wide angle camera which is great but the issue lies in the primary camera. For apparent no reasons the camera would go out of focus and even after trying for many minutes will not correct itself. Another thing is the zoom, as soon as you go above 2x, the quality will go towards bad and light capturing decreases.Apart from these issues, the phone is great. the mini screen in the back is a nice addition.Read more; I have been using the phone for the last 3 months.

Don't buy if you are looking for an impressive camera or a gaming phone.; First and foremost I would like to say that there is nothing great about this smartphone. What I mean is this is a jack of all trades kind of thing.1. Design and display - Look wise this thing is a beauty. Weight is slightly higher than what I would like but not a deal breaker. That nipple notch people complain about is not even an issue as your brain automatically gets used to it fairly quickly.Coming to display this is my first samsung phone and as everyone says samsung panels are the best and they are not wrong. Sharpness is great,colors produced are excellent and black and whites are rich and detailed all the way. Brightness is more than good enough for both outdoor use and use in dark room at night as it does get very dim so your eyes don't strain as much.2. Camera - Both rear and front produce really good photo and video quality given the lighting conditions are good. Low light quality is decent enough. Photos come out a little saturated but nothing over the top. Although sometimes I feel there is a slight shutter lag when there are lots of details in the frame. Front camera produces ample details and good skin tones.3. Performance- There is no lag in the UI or any heavy apps . Everything runs buttery smooth provided 120hz refresh rate setting is always on. I did some casual gaming and there were no frame drops or jitters whatsoever.  Also I would like to add if you want to go for heavy gaming you would want to go to game launcher settings and turn high performance mode and also a setting that turns on high frame rate with touch controls. All in all this is more than good enough for 90% of things you throw at it.4. Battery - After reading many mixed reviews I was quite skeptical about battery life but man was I proven wrong. After finishing setup and installing 30plus apps I full charged my phone and did a complete one day (24hrs)heavy usage to check battery life . I easily got 8plus SOT on mixed 5g and wifi ,screen brightness ranging from 30-80%. Usage ranged from social media, YouTube, camera , some games, phone customization and both network and whatsapp calls. Battery idle drain is also very minimal.5. Speakers - This is where things get weird. Don't get me wrong the sound is Rich loud and dare I say brilliant.  But there is one issue.  Whenever you turn Dolby atmos on and keep volume around 40% the back panel near the bottom will vibrate and its the annoying kind of vibrations. I tried with a case but there was not much difference. You need to learn to hold slightly differently or ignore it.6. Price - After coupons and bank offers I got a pretty good deal and feel like this is a value for money phone. (Avoid it if you get it around 28k or more.)7. Charging- There is no charger provided so add another 1k to your total budget.  Charging while on the slow side comparatively a 25 W samsung charger takes around 25 minutes to go from 20-85% which is the range we should be charging our phones anyway to make the batteries working life as long as possible so charging time is not an issue for me personally .8. Network - Network seems to be good enough on both 5g ,LTE and wifi. No call drops or voice breaks whatsoever. Internet speeds are very good as well.9. Fingerprint sensor - This is another area which has annoyed me . Setting up fingerprints is easy but very rarely it just behaves like a stubborn child and doesn't want to work at all. I needed to restart the device  two times which fixed the issue. Otherwise most of the times it's reliable( works 9/10 attempts) and decently fast ( takes .75 seconds approximately).This is it guys . All in all a good device with very few compromises. Heavy gamers should look elsewhere though.  I would update review after a major update is available.

The phone's performance is lightning-fast, thanks to the powerful processor and ample RAM. The display is stunning, with vibrant colors and crisp visuals. Battery life is impressive, easily lasting a day with heavy usage. Cameras are top-notch, capturing detailed photos and videos. The design is sleek and premium, with a comfortable grip. Call quality is top notch, even in low network areas.Cons: software and security update as given are for 03 years and 04 years respectively, they could have offered for more like for 05 years, though the phone came with Hyper OS and Android 14 out of th the box, comparing to the initial phone which came with MIUI 14 and Android 13. It will be a long wait to see how many updates i will be getting.Other only minor gripe is the lack of wireless charging, but that's a small trade-off for the incredible value this phone offers. Overall, I'm thoroughly enjoying my Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus experience and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a high-performance device without breaking the bank. My review - A premium package on a mid range budget.Read more; I've been using the Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus for a week now, and I must say, it's exceeded my expectations in almost every department!

While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.Update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.Read more; First impressions:1. While it has a LCD display.

Especially from the performance aspect, the snapdragon 8s gen3 performs like a flagship beast giving stable 120 fps in COD mobile, bgmi and other demanding games. The phone sometimes heats up while charging or when 120 fps is unlocked but it isn't that big of deal, like it doesn't overheat and given the fps it provides the little heating is justified. The cameras are better than expected and the battery life is phenomenal, easily lasts 1.5-2 days on moderate usage. The display and haptics are top notch too. Just funtouch os needs some refinement which I hope will be solved with future updates. Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍Read more; Good phone all in all.

Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi. And about CODM,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. Crazy good phone for CODM. For FC Mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. The lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. For codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed B in coastal S&D and 4 players were camping there. In FC Mobile no drops straight up 60. Crazy performance. The cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. So if you want natural photo than it's not good. Display is Crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. One more thing that is annoying is the UI, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. Good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy. Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.Read more; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi.

Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions. In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer.Read more; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions.

One of my primary reasons to buy this phone.- Camera quality at this price is way above average.- Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point.- One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations.- No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer.- Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.Cons:- Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g.- Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated.- Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage.- There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates.- Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram. Ultra wide camera, 50MB camera with Sony sensor and OIS. Super Amoled display and 6000 MaH battery. UI is also good. Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.Read more; I have searched lot of phones in this price range, no one giving you all in one phone. Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram.

Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center.

The booting time is pretty fast. No lag and cameras are pretty decent. Though water resistant and damage proof, does not mean that you can throw/drop the device anywhere and anyhow.

Here's an overview of its highlights and areas where it falls short:### **Positives**1. **Stunning Display**: The 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display is a visual treat with vibrant colors, deep blacks, and a buttery smooth 120Hz refresh rate. It performs exceptionally well even under direct sunlight.2. **Solid Build Quality**: With an Armor Aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus 2, the phone feels sturdy yet premium. It's also IP68-certified for water and dust resistance.3. **Top-notch Performance**: Powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, the S24+ delivers seamless multitasking and gaming experiences. Apps load quickly, and heavy games run without any noticeable lag.4. **Impressive Camera System**: The triple-camera setup includes a 50MP main sensor, a 12MP ultra-wide, and a 10MP telephoto lens. Photos are sharp, well-detailed, and dynamic, even in low-light conditions. The AI enhancements add a professional touch to your pictures.5. **Battery Life**: The 4900mAh battery easily lasts a full day with moderate to heavy use, and the 45W fast charging ensures you’re back in action quickly.6. **Software Experience**: One UI 6.1 is polished and intuitive, offering a plethora of customization options and thoughtful features like DeX mode for productivity enthusiasts.### **Negatives**1. **Price Point**: At its premium price, the S24+ competes with other flagship devices that offer similar or slightly better features, making it a tough sell for budget-conscious users.2. **Limited Optical Zoom**: The 3x optical zoom feels underwhelming compared to competitors like the Google Pixel 8 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro, which offer higher zoom capabilities.3. **No MicroSD Slot**: Samsung has once again omitted the microSD card slot, which might disappoint users who rely on expandable storage.4. **Bloatware**: Despite being a flagship, the S24+ comes pre-installed with unnecessary apps that detract from the otherwise premium experience.5. **Charging Brick Not Included**: Following industry trends, Samsung does not include a charging brick in the box, which can be inconvenient for those without a compatible charger.The Samsung Galaxy S24+ is a fantastic all-rounder that excels in design, performance, and camera capabilities. While it has a few shortcomings, they are relatively minor compared to its overall excellence.

I can see some dents on the box. It's not a good way to handle the package which has high value products inside. Very disappointed.; I bought this phone recently and because my previous phone was also based on exynos and it definitely had lower internet  and hotspot speed when compared even to cheaper phone of that time I was quite scared that the same thing will happen again. And sadly, my fears were right. The first thing I did was compare internet speed with my other phone and the speed was less than half of what was in other phone. These two times can't be a coincidence. I tried everything to accont for any error. I even exchanged the SIMs even though both were Jio, so that I am 100% sure.There is definitely some problem with exynos processor and internet speeds but I didn't know the drop would be less than half of what others are giving.Also there are genuine heating issues. Even for day to day task it would heat up. I knew about heating issues in Exynos but thought it was a premium flagship phone and my usage is quite light so it wouldn't make a difference. But, it did make a difference. Even on a 5-10 minues call it would heat up and become uncomfortable.Really feel cheated out of my money this time. I guess there is a reason they don't sell exynos in USA and China. Also there is  reason there was no exynos in S23 series and neither it is in S25.Once you buy the product can only be replaced and not returned, so you will be stuck with a smartphone where the most basic and the most critical function of a stable and fast internet itself is not there. Plus heating issues even on basic tasks will lead to throttling and slowing down ruining your experience.It is definitely not worth the money even on a huge discount which would be coming as I don't think otherwise anybody would buy it.The whole purpose of me writing this review (I generally don't review products) is to feel at least some sense of comfort that somebody else may not lose his/her money like I did, reading my review.If you want Samsung only - go for S23 series or S25 or S24 ultra but at all cost avoid Exynos processor. They are definitely, with multiple, and over the years, empirical evidence have significantly (not just slightly) poor and unstable internet speeds and really bad heating problems and it doesn't matter what is the pattern of your usage and these reviewers on youtube dont' tell us that.My Speed Test Data: On Snapdragon with Jio5G - Upto 140, always 100 Mbps + ; On Exynos with same SIM - Max 30-40 and on average 20-30, but the catch it is very unstable so a lot of time below 10 and even below 1.AVOID EXYNOS.

With moderate usage on WiFi, can easily last upto 2 days. Also, there is very less battery drain when idle, especially overnight. Definitely one of the best with 6000 mAh. One of my primary reasons to buy this phone.- Camera quality at this price is way above average.- Finally, punch hole display from Samsung for M series and at this price point.- One UI software is very stable and comes with plenty of customisations.- No issues in performance with multitasking involving streaming videos, music, social media apps, browser surfing, etc. Can't say about gaming as I am not a gamer.- Up to 4 gens of software updates which hardly any company provides even with flagship phones. But need to keep in mind that the product page on Samsung's website clearly states that this is not a promise but just their current plans, and it can be changed anytime at their own discretion.Cons:- Bulky (which is expected considering the massive battery), holding with one hand for extended period of time causes discomfort, specially if you are used to phones weighing below 175g.- Headphone jack missing. Considering the thickness of the phone, this could easily have been accommodated.- Phone does not come with any IP rating which is surprising, so any contact with water might potentially cause damage.- There is a noticeable battery drain with 5G network, but could be improved in future software updates.- Not specific to this phone but with all Samsung phones: Missing charging adaptor, back cover, and screen protector.

The functioning and screen is excellent . It has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. The battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. The device features quick charging functionality. The display quality is good. During the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. The phone doesn't have an IP certification due to which contact with water might damage it. This purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.Read more; I had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations.

Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram. Ultra wide camera, 50MB camera with Sony sensor and OIS. Super Amoled display and 6000 MaH battery. UI is also good. Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.Read more; I have searched lot of phones in this price range, no one giving you all in one phone. Here it is, great to see a variant with 6GB ram.

Only two things to say, because of the Exynos processor I am doubting of heavy tasking like gaming and editing (till now no lagging or heating issue) and why not charger in the box? By the way a value for money product.; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. Thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, I decided to stick with the known devil. And besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the M30, that this will replace. That too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.Initial impressions so far has been decent. They have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the M3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. Even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship S series with the flat sides and no camera island. No sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.Samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), And this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. My primary phone too is heavy (not Samsung) so I am used to it, but I would nonetheless like a lighter phone. My father's M52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.If you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. The 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. I'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.I like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. Better than the in display type I think. It supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. The base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.They have dropped the audio jack, but I have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but I know there are die hard fans. A related drawback though is that FM radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. I didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.Not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. Didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. No heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. I dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.For regular needs this phone should be fine I think. If it stays this way for a few years I think I will be happy with this phone. On paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. I took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. I havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. Fingers crossed. Giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.Read more; Bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 Samsung phones I have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, Although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center.

While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.Update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.Read more; First impressions:1. While it has a LCD display.

And about CODM,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. Crazy good phone for CODM. For FC Mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. The lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. For codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed B in coastal S&D and 4 players were camping there. In FC Mobile no drops straight up 60. Crazy performance. The cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. So if you want natural photo than it's not good. Display is Crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. One more thing that is annoying is the UI, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. Good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy.

Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions. In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer.Read more; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions.

Here’s a closer look at its key aspects:Design and Display:The Aqua Flow variant looks sleek with its gradient finish, adding a touch of elegance. The phone is lightweight and comfortable to hold, making it easy for one-handed use. Its 6.58-inch Full HD+ display is sharp and vibrant, offering good color reproduction and brightness for media consumption. Though not AMOLED, the display performs well in outdoor lighting conditions and provides smooth scrolling with a 120Hz refresh rate.Performance:Powered by the Dimensity 6300 5G chipset, this device ensures a snappy and fluid user experience. It handles multitasking well, although the 4GB RAM might struggle slightly with heavier apps and games when compared to 6GB or 8GB variants. For regular usage like social media, video streaming, and casual gaming, the phone performs admirably. The inclusion of 5G support is a strong future-proofing move, especially at this price point.Camera:The 50MP Sony AI Camera setup is one of the phone’s strongest features. It takes good-quality pictures in daylight with sharp details and vivid colors. However, low-light performance could be better, as images tend to get noisy in dim environments. The AI optimizations, such as scene recognition, enhance the photography experience, making it easy to capture decent shots with minimal effort. The front camera is decent for selfies and video calls, though not exceptional.Battery and Charging:The phone packs a 5000mAh battery, which easily lasts a full day of moderate use. The charger in the box is a nice touch, offering fast charging support that gets the phone charged in under two hours. Battery optimization is good, ensuring you won’t run out of juice during regular day-to-day tasks.Storage and Software:With 128GB of storage, there’s ample room for apps, media, and files, and the phone supports microSD expansion if needed. The software experience is clean and customizable with iQOO’s Funtouch OS, which runs smoothly on Android. The UI is user-friendly, though there are some pre-installed apps that may not be necessary, but they can be uninstalled.Verdict:The iQOO Z9 Lite 5G is a competitive mid-range smartphone with solid performance, 5G support, a reliable camera, and good battery life.

Here’s a closer look at its key aspects:Design and Display:The Aqua Flow variant looks sleek with its gradient finish, adding a touch of elegance. The phone is lightweight and comfortable to hold, making it easy for one-handed use. Its 6.58-inch Full HD+ display is sharp and vibrant, offering good color reproduction and brightness for media consumption. Though not AMOLED, the display performs well in outdoor lighting conditions and provides smooth scrolling with a 120Hz refresh rate.Performance:Powered by the Dimensity 6300 5G chipset, this device ensures a snappy and fluid user experience. It handles multitasking well, although the 4GB RAM might struggle slightly with heavier apps and games when compared to 6GB or 8GB variants. For regular usage like social media, video streaming, and casual gaming, the phone performs admirably. The inclusion of 5G support is a strong future-proofing move, especially at this price point.Camera:The 50MP Sony AI Camera setup is one of the phone’s strongest features. It takes good-quality pictures in daylight with sharp details and vivid colors. However, low-light performance could be better, as images tend to get noisy in dim environments. The AI optimizations, such as scene recognition, enhance the photography experience, making it easy to capture decent shots with minimal effort.

Here's an overview of its highlights and areas where it falls short:### **Positives**1. **Stunning Display**: The 6.7-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display is a visual treat with vibrant colors, deep blacks, and a buttery smooth 120Hz refresh rate. It performs exceptionally well even under direct sunlight.2. **Solid Build Quality**: With an Armor Aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass Victus 2, the phone feels sturdy yet premium. It's also IP68-certified for water and dust resistance.3. **Top-notch Performance**: Powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, the S24+ delivers seamless multitasking and gaming experiences. Apps load quickly, and heavy games run without any noticeable lag.4. **Impressive Camera System**: The triple-camera setup includes a 50MP main sensor, a 12MP ultra-wide, and a 10MP telephoto lens. Photos are sharp, well-detailed, and dynamic, even in low-light conditions. The AI enhancements add a professional touch to your pictures.5. **Battery Life**: The 4900mAh battery easily lasts a full day with moderate to heavy use, and the 45W fast charging ensures you’re back in action quickly.6. **Software Experience**: One UI 6.1 is polished and intuitive, offering a plethora of customization options and thoughtful features like DeX mode for productivity enthusiasts.### **Negatives**1. **Price Point**: At its premium price, the S24+ competes with other flagship devices that offer similar or slightly better features, making it a tough sell for budget-conscious users.2. **Limited Optical Zoom**: The 3x optical zoom feels underwhelming compared to competitors like the Google Pixel 8 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro, which offer higher zoom capabilities.3. **No MicroSD Slot**: Samsung has once again omitted the microSD card slot, which might disappoint users who rely on expandable storage.4. **Bloatware**: Despite being a flagship, the S24+ comes pre-installed with unnecessary apps that detract from the otherwise premium experience.5. **Charging Brick Not Included**: Following industry trends, Samsung does not include a charging brick in the box, which can be inconvenient for those without a compatible charger.The Samsung Galaxy S24+ is a fantastic all-rounder that excels in design, performance, and camera capabilities. While it has a few shortcomings, they are relatively minor compared to its overall excellence.

I can see some dents on the box. It's not a good way to handle the package which has high value products inside. Very disappointed.; I bought this phone recently and because my previous phone was also based on exynos and it definitely had lower internet  and hotspot speed when compared even to cheaper phone of that time I was quite scared that the same thing will happen again. And sadly, my fears were right. The first thing I did was compare internet speed with my other phone and the speed was less than half of what was in other phone. These two times can't be a coincidence. I tried everything to accont for any error. I even exchanged the SIMs even though both were Jio, so that I am 100% sure.There is definitely some problem with exynos processor and internet speeds but I didn't know the drop would be less than half of what others are giving.Also there are genuine heating issues. Even for day to day task it would heat up. I knew about heating issues in Exynos but thought it was a premium flagship phone and my usage is quite light so it wouldn't make a difference. But, it did make a difference. Even on a 5-10 minues call it would heat up and become uncomfortable.Really feel cheated out of my money this time. I guess there is a reason they don't sell exynos in USA and China. Also there is  reason there was no exynos in S23 series and neither it is in S25.Once you buy the product can only be replaced and not returned, so you will be stuck with a smartphone where the most basic and the most critical function of a stable and fast internet itself is not there. Plus heating issues even on basic tasks will lead to throttling and slowing down ruining your experience.It is definitely not worth the money even on a huge discount which would be coming as I don't think otherwise anybody would buy it.The whole purpose of me writing this review (I generally don't review products) is to feel at least some sense of comfort that somebody else may not lose his/her money like I did, reading my review.If you want Samsung only - go for S23 series or S25 or S24 ultra but at all cost avoid Exynos processor. They are definitely, with multiple, and over the years, empirical evidence have significantly (not just slightly) poor and unstable internet speeds and really bad heating problems and it doesn't matter what is the pattern of your usage and these reviewers on youtube dont' tell us that.My Speed Test Data: On Snapdragon with Jio5G - Upto 140, always 100 Mbps + ; On Exynos with same SIM - Max 30-40 and on average 20-30, but the catch it is very unstable so a lot of time below 10 and even below 1.AVOID EXYNOS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. Else it is your money and yours to waste.Read more; I bought this phone recently and because my previous phone was also based on exynos and it definitely had lower internet  and hotspot speed when compared even to cheaper phone of that time I was quite scared that the same thing will happen again.

While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.Update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. A capable set of speakers.

But it's not for these Gen z kids, UI and software is simple and clean. Not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.Phone is heating as common as other phones.Battery life average for 5000mahValue for money; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time.

Totally happy with the phone.; I purchased the black variant with leather finish and have been using it for 3 weeks.What can I say about this phone man?? I have been using iPhone 13 Pro max  since two years and this phone felt like a decade equalant upgrade.  Whatever task you throw at this phone , this beast flies. I have literally played PUBG and call of duty side by side and there was nonframw drop or lag on this Phone.Inwas actually hesitatsnt to buy this OnePlus foldable due to durability concern and battery life but purchased anyways.The phone's build is sturdy and the same goes for hinge mechanism . I have never used a fold before but I can say it's not a durability concern.The battery life is awesome and you can easily get one and half a day's  medium usage.Software is snappy, multi tasking and software features are much refined compared to Samsung z fold 5 and great for productivity.I am also surprised, this has many other features OnePlus did not highlight, like tent mode and support for the stylus support (it supports the oppo pen compatible with oppo find N3/N2).

So no need to purchase anything else.Regarding device,it have excellent display quality, good battery life,good camera,etc..I don't have any cons now.

While it has a LCD display. It appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. Although it's 120hz RR, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to Smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. There are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. Battery backup is definitely its USP. Having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. Takes around 1.5 hours to fully Charge.6. Camera is nothing to brag about. It's a decent single shooter. No ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. Lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. All other phones are offering MTK6100 while it has SD6Gen1 which definitely performs better. And there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. Very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.Overall, a very solid phone in the price range.Update: One star deducted - The camera quality is abysmal. There is no optimization done on the camera. Colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.Update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. With light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. Phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. A capable set of speakers. While they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.Read more; First impressions:1. While it has a LCD display.

The edge cutting and blurring the background are just top-notch.The videos are stable, capture the exact colour, retailing is good and they are not noisly and the low light videos are good not too good.And the low light photos are decent, but the photo from night mode are absolutely amazing and it's retailing is good and selfies are also niceAbout the macro and ultra wide:To be practical we won't use it in our day to day like.If ur need is good and decent photos and videos just for it u, will love it.If u want a better camera and  u are buying it only for camera and features, this won't be right choice.4) Connectivity:I haven't faced any issues with the connectivity till now but from my experience, it's is up to the mark.I am using Airtel with a 4g sim and I got upto 270mbs speed.And the Bluetooth connectivity is amazing.5) Case and conclusion:The case they are giving is rigid and the in hand feel is good. They are not slippery and does it's job.To conclude, you won't get a better phone at this price range, with lot of features, performance and a great camera. I would granty u, it will a hell of a experience.Thankyou!Read more; This review is from my past 2week of experience.I would say this mobile is one of the best and value for money mobile in this price segment.1)Performance:The mobile performs seemlessly in all the tasks it went through.I Played bgmi and other games in high settings and the phone handed it very well.But I also faced heating issue with higher setting, which is common but  it didn't affect it's performance and few fps drops2) Display:One word to describe, awesome.The colour are pretty accurate, bright and the haptics are great which feels like the phone is communicating.I heard from other comments, the display is not good under the sun, yeah that's true but it's is still visible to use the phone under the direct sun light without any problem.3) Charging and Battery standby:It takes 30-35 minutes to full charge, that's pretty great for a phone at this price range.It takes 20 minutes to charge the phone to 80%, and I would also recommend you to charge it till 80 by turning on the option so the battery life last long.And about the backup, it solidly last more than a day for normal use and when u play games it drains faster.U can play for around 3hrs with 80% charge.Camera:It's performance is pretty amazing, I won't it is the great but it does it's job.The colors, skin tone, background  accurate and especially the portraits, really perfect.

It has a great processor, a long-lasting battery, and a beautiful display. The software is also very clean and simple to use. However, the camera could be better, and there is no expandable storage or headphone jack.Here is a more detailed look at the pros and cons of the OnePlus 11R:Pros:1) Powerful Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor: The OnePlus 11R is powered by the latest Snapdragon 8+ Gen 1 processor, which is one of the most powerful mobile processors on the market. This means that the phone is incredibly fast and can handle even the most demanding tasks with ease.2) I have played  games like Genshin Impact, PUBG, Call of Duty and Asphalt games runs really smooth.3) Long-lasting battery with 100 W fast charging: The OnePlus 11R has a large 5000mAh battery, which is more than enough to power the phone for a full day on a single charge. The phone also supports 100 W fast charging, which means that you can quickly top up the battery when you need to.4) I am fan of  curved screen it gives you premium look. I haven't seen any accidental touches from my side. The OnePlus 11R has a beautiful 6.7-inch AMOLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate. This means that the display is incredibly smooth and responsive, and it's perfect for gaming or watching videos.4) Clean and simple software: The OnePlus 11R runs OxygenOS, which is one of the cleanest and simplest Android skins on the market. The software is very easy to use, and it doesn't come with any bloatware.Cons:1) Battery drain fast. I have observed battery drain issue. I usually keep phone Wi-Fi on when I go to sleep within 3 to 4 hours it drains 10% to 15% of battery which is not good.2) While I have seen Lag sometimes but gaming gives you smooth experience.3) The OnePlus 11R has a triple-lens rear camera system, but the camera performance is not as good as some of the other phones in this price range. The main camera is good, but the ultrawide and macro cameras are not as good.Overall, the OnePlus 11R is a great phone for those who are looking for a powerful and affordable device.

Especially from the performance aspect, the snapdragon 8s gen3 performs like a flagship beast giving stable 120 fps in COD mobile, bgmi and other demanding games. The phone sometimes heats up while charging or when 120 fps is unlocked but it isn't that big of deal, like it doesn't overheat and given the fps it provides the little heating is justified. The cameras are better than expected and the battery life is phenomenal, easily lasts 1.5-2 days on moderate usage. The display and haptics are top notch too. Just funtouch os needs some refinement which I hope will be solved with future updates. Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍Read more; Good phone all in all.

Thanks to Amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi. And about CODM,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. Crazy good phone for CODM. For FC Mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. The lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. For codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed B in coastal S&D and 4 players were camping there. In FC Mobile no drops straight up 60. Crazy performance. The cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. So if you want natural photo than it's not good. Display is Crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. One more thing that is annoying is the UI, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. Good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy. Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.Read more; Great phone with crazy performance.The only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.Other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in T3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi.

Videography and UI is the only downside of this phone.Want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions. In a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. However, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.The phone I'm referring to is the iQOO Neo 10R. Priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.Here's a breakdown of my experience:Performance: At the heart of this device lies the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset. This powerful processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like BGMI and COD Mobile at high settings. I was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. The AnTuTu GPU score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.Display: The 6.78-inch AMOLED display with a 144Hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. The colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. While the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.Gaming Features: iQOO has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the Neo 10R. It boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in FPS meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'Monster Mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. The inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.Battery: The 6400mAh battery is a significant highlight. It easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. Even after intense gaming sessions, I was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.Other Notable Aspects:* The phone supports 5G connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* It features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. The 50MP main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* The software experience is clean and optimized for performance.Areas for Potential Improvement:* While the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* The camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.Overall:The iQOO Neo 10R offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. Its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. While there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. If gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iQOO Neo 10R deserves a serious look.Sincerely,A Satisfied Mobile Gamer.Read more; Dear Tech Enthusiast,I recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and I felt compelled to share my impressions.

In fact, the battery runs smoothly for two days in normal usage. I am not a gamer, so can't review the performance in that aspect.

But it's not for these Gen z kids, UI and software is simple and clean. Not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.Phone is heating as common as other phones.Battery life average for 5000mahValue for money; I am using Samsung after a long time. Especially, I have never used Samsung android before. And now I don’t want to use other android phones at all. One UI is really a charm. Lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean UI, that’s what I can tell about Samsung’s One UI, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. Now I understand why people who used Samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. At least, I don’t want to switch very soon.Now coming to the phone. I have got this for Rs. 34000/- during the Big Billion Day sale.Battery: My main concern was the battery, and this is the reason I didn’t go for S23 FE, which was available at almost the same price. The battery in the A55 is better than the one in S23 FE. In fact, I would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. It gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. I charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. The battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. Set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.Build Quality: The reason I didn’t go for the A35. Both are designed the same, but the A55 has an Aluminium frame. It makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. I admit that the Aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. And I intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.Display: I think I don’t need to say much about Samsung’s display. It has a 120Hz SAMOLED screen, which is very beautiful. You can limit the refresh rate to 60Hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.Update Policy: Samsung promises to provide 4 years of Android updates and 5 years of Security updates. I think Samsung will keep their promise, and I will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.Camera: Camera isn’t one of the USPs of this phone, mostly for the redundant Macro sensor. The Macro sensor isn’t very good. They could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the S23 FE. The 50MP main camera and the 12MP ultrawide lens is good. Low light photography is also very good with this camera. I guess its not possible to upgrade a Macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.Adaptability: Last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. You will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.The Samsung Galaxy A55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.Read more; I am using Samsung after a long time.
