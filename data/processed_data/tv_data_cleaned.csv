but fr some reason i could not purchase the extended warranty. but at the time of installation, the jeeves technician offered me extended warranty from them - so, i bought - 2 yrs for 1100rs. am glad i couldn't buy extended warranty at time of checkout.. and since jeeves is the main entity handling repairs etc, it was better to buy from them... so now my cheap tv has a 1+2=3yr warranty! nice!!!tv - picture quality - ok.. does the job pretty well, the 15k-20k+rs tv will be better.. but i don't care, at this price. the non-hd channels have slightly pixellated edges, but i noticed that if i reduced the sharpness to 0, the problem goes away. everything else is all good - only thing is the ""whites"" seems a bit over-exposed/too bright, and if you reduce the brightness and contrast so that pure white ares of the picture looks alright, then the dark/shadowy/black areas of the picture appear too dark... you have to strike a balance(best settings worked for me at - brightness-55, contrast-35, sharpness-0, colour/saturation-35... good balance of reducing overexposed whites and maximising dark-zone clarity), but trust me.. at this price, this is nothing, and you would have a good viewing experience. all other features - eco mode, sound, build quality etc is pretty decent.. no complaints there.final verdict - go for it! super low price, pretty good viewing experience.. total value for money.. definitely go for it if your priority is getting max for your money.. if priority is quality, go for samsung, lg etc. also, i'd suggest - skip the extended warranty and buy the same at installation time from the jeeves technician - he may not offer it to you on his own, so ask for it.read more; top quality tvs (sony, samsung, lg) are about 2.5-3 times the price... cheap tv (but reputed names.. like mi, micromax) are abt 2 times this price - this is so low price (other similar priced tvs were of unknown brands.. kevin has made some name/presence by now), i was pretty sure it was a cheap quality dud! i thought if this tv lasted the warranty period, then its still value for money,... so i took the risk.tv arrived.. it stopped working on the same day!!!!!! inspection+replacement request registered with amazon.. smooth experience there, finally replaced.. and the new tv works perfectly.note - the installation+warranty time servicing+repairs etc.. has been outsourced by kevin to a third party company called jeeves.. they're all digital, with all communications and visits etc recorded via sms-es, emails, etc... very professional. so, if tv ever gets spoilt, the toll-free experience+service/repair experience should be trouble-free.also note - there is an extended warranty provided at the time of purchase - for such a cheap tv, if i had 1 yr of extra warranty, then why not?

honest review of my tv purchase – read before you buy!i recently purchased this tv, and after using it for some time, i have a few important observations to share. this is a long message, but it's worth reading if you're considering this product.delivery experience:the delivery process was smooth, and i have no complaints about it.tv size issue:the listing mentions a 32-inch (79 cm) tv, whereas most 32-inch tvs usually measure 82 cm. however, when i manually measured it using tape, it came out to just 72 cm. this is misleading, and i’m unsure whom to report this to. if you have a 100 sq. ft. room, this tv might feel too small, and a 43-inch tv would be a better choice. that being said, the picture quality and sound system are impressive.installation scam – beware!this was the most frustrating part. they advertise free installation, but here’s the catch:1. wall mounting issue: they force you to buy their tv wall mount stand, even though the terms and conditions mention it as an additional cost, not mandatory.2. extra charges: i had already purchased a compatible tv wall mount from amazon, but the installation team still demanded ₹450 for installation. if i had bought their stand, they would have charged even more, which goes against the listed terms.3. comparison with other brands: i have installed another tv from a different brand via amazon, and the process was seamless with no such issues.final thoughts:if you're buying this tv, be prepared for misleading size specifications and forced installation charges. while the tv itself performs well in terms of quality and sound, the installation process was frustrating and felt like a scam.hope this helps others make an informed decisions!read more;
