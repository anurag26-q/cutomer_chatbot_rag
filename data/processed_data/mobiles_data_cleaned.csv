i had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations. the functioning and screen is excellent . it has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. the battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. the device features quick charging functionality. the display quality is good. during the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. the phone doesn't have an ip certification due to which contact with water might damage it. this purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.read more;

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

i am using samsung after a long time. especially, i have never used samsung android before. and now i don’t want to use other android phones at all. one ui is really a charm. lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean ui, that’s what i can tell about samsung’s one ui, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. now i understand why people who used samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. at least, i don’t want to switch very soon.now coming to the phone. i have got this for rs. 34000/- during the big billion day sale.battery: my main concern was the battery, and this is the reason i didn’t go for s23 fe, which was available at almost the same price. the battery in the a55 is better than the one in s23 fe. in fact, i would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. it gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. i charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. the battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.build quality: the reason i didn’t go for the a35. both are designed the same, but the a55 has an aluminium frame. it makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. i admit that the aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. and i intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.display: i think i don’t need to say much about samsung’s display. it has a 120hz samoled screen, which is very beautiful. you can limit the refresh rate to 60hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.update policy: samsung promises to provide 4 years of android updates and 5 years of security updates. i think samsung will keep their promise, and i will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.camera: camera isn’t one of the usps of this phone, mostly for the redundant macro sensor. the macro sensor isn’t very good. they could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the s23 fe. the 50mp main camera and the 12mp ultrawide lens is good. low light photography is also very good with this camera. i guess its not possible to upgrade a macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.adaptability: last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. you will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.the samsung galaxy a55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.read more;

i am using samsung after a long time. especially, i have never used samsung android before. and now i don’t want to use other android phones at all. one ui is really a charm. lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean ui, that’s what i can tell about samsung’s one ui, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. now i understand why people who used samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. at least, i don’t want to switch very soon.now coming to the phone. i have got this for rs. 34000/- during the big billion day sale.battery: my main concern was the battery, and this is the reason i didn’t go for s23 fe, which was available at almost the same price. the battery in the a55 is better than the one in s23 fe. in fact, i would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. it gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. i charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. the battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.build quality: the reason i didn’t go for the a35. both are designed the same, but the a55 has an aluminium frame. it makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. i admit that the aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. and i intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.display: i think i don’t need to say much about samsung’s display. it has a 120hz samoled screen, which is very beautiful. you can limit the refresh rate to 60hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.update policy: samsung promises to provide 4 years of android updates and 5 years of security updates. i think samsung will keep their promise, and i will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.camera: camera isn’t one of the usps of this phone, mostly for the redundant macro sensor. the macro sensor isn’t very good. they could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the s23 fe. the 50mp main camera and the 12mp ultrawide lens is good. low light photography is also very good with this camera. i guess its not possible to upgrade a macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.adaptability: last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. you will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.the samsung galaxy a55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.read more;

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

good phone all in all. especially from the performance aspect, the snapdragon 8s gen3 performs like a flagship beast giving stable 120 fps in cod mobile, bgmi and other demanding games. the phone sometimes heats up while charging or when 120 fps is unlocked but it isn't that big of deal, like it doesn't overheat and given the fps it provides the little heating is justified. the cameras are better than expected and the battery life is phenomenal, easily lasts 1.5-2 days on moderate usage. the display and haptics are top notch too. just funtouch os needs some refinement which i hope will be solved with future updates. thanks to amazon for timely delivery and good product 👍read more;

dear tech enthusiast,i recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and i felt compelled to share my impressions. in a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. however, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.the phone i'm referring to is the iqoo neo 10r. priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.here's a breakdown of my experience:performance: at the heart of this device lies the snapdragon 8s gen 3 chipset. this powerful processor, coupled with 8gb of ram, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like bgmi and cod mobile at high settings. i was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. the antutu gpu score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.display: the 6.78-inch amoled display with a 144hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. the colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. while the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.gaming features: iqoo has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the neo 10r. it boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in fps meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'monster mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. the inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.battery: the 6400mah battery is a significant highlight. it easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. even after intense gaming sessions, i was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.other notable aspects:* the phone supports 5g connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* it features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. the 50mp main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* the software experience is clean and optimized for performance.areas for potential improvement:* while the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* the camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.overall:the iqoo neo 10r offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. while there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. if gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iqoo neo 10r deserves a serious look.sincerely,a satisfied mobile gamer.read more;

a frustrating experience with realme and amazoni recently purchased the realme narzo 61 from amazon, but my excitement was short-lived. the device turned out to be defective, and the experience that followed was nothing short of frustrating.the initial problemupon receiving the device, i noticed that it had significant issues, including voice breakdown during calls. i promptly contacted amazon's customer support, expecting a seamless replacement or refund process. however, to my surprise, they refused to replace the device, suggesting that i contact realme's support team instead.the runaroundi reached out to realme's support team, hoping that they would be more helpful. unfortunately, the issue persisted, and i was told that the problem was not resolved. the voice breakdown during calls continued, rendering the device unusable.the replacement and refund period*as per amazon's policy, i was within the 7-day replacement and refund period. however, both amazon and realme seemed unwilling to take responsibility for the defective device. realme's service center refused to provide a denial letter, which amazon required for a refund.a catch-22 situationthis created a catch-22 situation, where amazon insisted that i needed a denial letter from realme to process a refund, while realme's service center refused to provide such a letter. i was left feeling frustrated and helpless, with no clear resolution in sight.a call for better customer support*as a customer, i expect a certain level of service from the companies i purchase from. in this case, both amazon and realme fell short of my expectations. i hope that they will take steps to improve their customer support and address the issues that i faced.*rating*- amazon: 1/5- realme: 1/5*recommendation*to anyone considering purchasing the realme narzo 61 or dealing with similar issues with these companies, i would advise exercising caution and being prepared for potential frustrations. it's essential to research and understand the customer support policies of both the manufacturer and the retailer before making a purchase.read more;

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

dear tech enthusiast,i recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and i felt compelled to share my impressions. in a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. however, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.the phone i'm referring to is the iqoo neo 10r. priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.here's a breakdown of my experience:performance: at the heart of this device lies the snapdragon 8s gen 3 chipset. this powerful processor, coupled with 8gb of ram, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like bgmi and cod mobile at high settings. i was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. the antutu gpu score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.display: the 6.78-inch amoled display with a 144hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. the colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. while the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.gaming features: iqoo has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the neo 10r. it boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in fps meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'monster mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. the inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.battery: the 6400mah battery is a significant highlight. it easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. even after intense gaming sessions, i was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.other notable aspects:* the phone supports 5g connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* it features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. the 50mp main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* the software experience is clean and optimized for performance.areas for potential improvement:* while the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* the camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.overall:the iqoo neo 10r offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. while there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. if gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iqoo neo 10r deserves a serious look.sincerely,a satisfied mobile gamer.read more;

so once switched off, the charging works well corresponding to a fast charger up to 90% of the battery charge status, after which it slows down and gets severely struck at 95% charging status. the last 5% take more than 15-20 mins!3. sound quality is pretty normal and ordinary compared to any other phone.4. the phone actually weighs more and is not as portable as my old 7.5k realme c12. the camera design is pretty lame and has no performance benefit over realme c12 in comparison. the circular extension at the back actually makes it difficult to hold a bit. the cameras are far more ordinary with just better color grading.5. it doesn't support airtel 5g as manufacturers admit.6. the memory capacity ram is 4g, which is 1g improvement over realme c12. but for an ordinary user with 4-5 years of use, this shouldn't affect him much, unless gaming or other performance extensive use.read more; 1. the claim that the camera quality is 50 megapixels is far from the truth. to test it, i compared it with realme c12, a 7-year-old 13-megapixel phone. except for the color grading of the pixel, nothing really has changed!

so once switched off, the charging works well corresponding to a fast charger up to 90% of the battery charge status, after which it slows down and gets severely struck at 95% charging status. the last 5% take more than 15-20 mins!3. sound quality is pretty normal and ordinary compared to any other phone.4. the phone actually weighs more and is not as portable as my old 7.5k realme c12. the camera design is pretty lame and has no performance benefit over realme c12 in comparison. the circular extension at the back actually makes it difficult to hold a bit. the cameras are far more ordinary with just better color grading.5. it doesn't support airtel 5g as manufacturers admit.6. the memory capacity ram is 4g, which is 1g improvement over realme c12. but for an ordinary user with 4-5 years of use, this shouldn't affect him much, unless gaming or other performance extensive use.; excellent product!

i had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations. the functioning and screen is excellent . it has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. the battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. the device features quick charging functionality. the display quality is good. during the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. the phone doesn't have an ip certification due to which contact with water might damage it. this purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.read more;

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

i never though i would give 1 star to this phone.. as i was literally waiting for this phone to be released. i've already used tecno phantom fold first version.. i was so impressed with that phone that even though it's display went dead suddenly after 1 year of purchase, i still decided to buy this fold 2 considering how good fold 1 was.. that was my big mistake.. since the day of purchase, i.e ,20th dec 2024,the hinge seemed somewhat tight... unlike fold 1 which was so easy to open.. i thought may be because it's a new one.. it's tighter.. and i hardly unfolded the phone these past few days as i was very busy with my work.. yesterday i was trying to unfold it as wanted to use 2 screens.. it was tighter.. i gave a but more pressure and suddenly heard a crack sound and flickering of display of mainscreen.. i was immediately reminded of the sudden dead screen of my first tecno fold one.. that one lasted atleast 1 yr.. this one hardly lasted 15 days.. i tool it to nearby carlcare centre.. that guy was saying you should have escalated this hinge problem immediately before the screen broke.i don't know if i can do anything now. or you have to pay 56000 rs for main screen replacement.imagine the pain when a device which you bought with so much anticipation at a price of 80k.. again costing 56k for repair..hope the tecno team will sort this out without me spending huge money from my pocket. if i have to pay 56k for it.. i would rather keep it aside and buy some other phone..amazon has accepted to take the product back and issue refund.. i have returned the product but after few days amazon was denting refund saying that wrong item was sent.. when i've contacted them, they told me product received was same but their is mismatch in some serial number..when i have asked them to show proof they are not showing. and moreover they are refusing to return the product back. the pickup boy has confirmed everything during pick up.. worst customer service by amazon.. they are not issuing refund and also not returning the phone back.. pathetic service from amazon. i have bought atleast 15 mobiles from amazon and shop atleast 15k to 20k every month from amazon.. yet their customer service is worst..read more;

dear tech enthusiast,i recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and i felt compelled to share my impressions. in a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. however, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.the phone i'm referring to is the iqoo neo 10r. priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.here's a breakdown of my experience:performance: at the heart of this device lies the snapdragon 8s gen 3 chipset. this powerful processor, coupled with 8gb of ram, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like bgmi and cod mobile at high settings. i was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. the antutu gpu score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.display: the 6.78-inch amoled display with a 144hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. the colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. while the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.gaming features: iqoo has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the neo 10r. it boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in fps meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'monster mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. the inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.battery: the 6400mah battery is a significant highlight. it easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. even after intense gaming sessions, i was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.other notable aspects:* the phone supports 5g connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* it features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. the 50mp main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* the software experience is clean and optimized for performance.areas for potential improvement:* while the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* the camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.overall:the iqoo neo 10r offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. while there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. if gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iqoo neo 10r deserves a serious look.sincerely,a satisfied mobile gamer.read more;

this is post 3 days of using of phone and simply couldn't resist myself from writing this review. got the razor green 12 gb 512 gb for 32k post bank discount. adding some context before diving into my experience. i was an s22 ultra user and ditched the same for oneplus 12 sd8g3. i wanted an add on phone for office use and for gaming (bgmi & mkx). got this one post going through round of comparisons against iqoos out there. not i just had one sim in the phone as i was using it. so coming straight to how i rate this phone. it is a 5/5 for me.looks: 4/5 ✌️✌️✌️✌️display: 5/5 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩touch response: 5/5 🧈🧈🧈🧈🧈performance: 5/5 ✨✨✨✨✨gaming performance: 5/5 👍👍👍👍👍speaker output: 5/5 ( very decent)battery: 10/5 ( simply marvellous)charging speed: 15/5 (no comments)camera: 4/5 (boosted this up from 3 to 4 based off overall happiness with the phone and considering the price factor)os: 4/5 (-1 because of few preloaded apps)finger print scanner: 5/5so what i loved: display and performance crisp and buttery smooth. os is clean too to the most. sd7+g3 takes on any tasks thrown on it with ease. no hassles in multitasking. got july security patch as of yesterday so all good on that front too. now speaking about what i'm in love with - being an s22 ultra user i must say the biggest pain point has been battery since day 1. max gaming time 3.5 hrs. in the initial days which reduced to 1.5 over a span of 2 years. stand-by was crazy bad too on s22 ultra. this lil gizmo gt 6t is a dream in this case. 3 days of game play bgmi 5 hrs. each day and was left with 22% of juice still remaining each time. and post sleep of 6 hrs. the phone still retained 17% of charge. this already is insane in my perspective.now coming to the charging aspect, this is unimaginable. lightning fast... 17% - 100% in 22 minutes. speechless in this front. sammy used to take like 1 hr and 10 mins. in the initial days and post an year and half i really don't know. gaming done without gtmode. frame rate was set to auto adaptive. bgmi played in smooth extreme+. brightness at ~45%. no throttling or heating. it got slightly warm at a point (really no where close to be called as heating) and then cooled too which is 😍😍😍.whatsapp, fb, insta, gmail, o365, teams and all other apps on the background. so you can go for this one blindfolded if you are looking for a phone with great backup and performance (gaming performance). i hope this is helpful.what i didn't like: given all of above a 3.5 mm slot was expected. and sound output in headphones could have been better. i used sony wh1000xm3 for gaming and wf1000xm4 for listening to music and watching movie to test the output. again you can hear all the footsteps and minute details and same applies to music if not all details but covers 90% of it but somewhere lacks the loudness factor by a bit and no dolby atmos so less to mention there.lastly, i didn't cover anything on cam perspective because i was really not looking at this phone from that aspect and me sharing my experience on that front will definitely make no sense as the comparison will be against s22 ultra here and this reaches no where close to it which is completely fine given it is not even 1/4th of the price for which i had bought s22 ultra. that said both front and rear cam are decent is all i can say from price point perspective.overall this is a bang on deal from my perspective and would definitely recommend going for it if you are not cam centric and looking for a great performer!read more;

i am using samsung after a long time. especially, i have never used samsung android before. and now i don’t want to use other android phones at all. one ui is really a charm. lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean ui, that’s what i can tell about samsung’s one ui, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. now i understand why people who used samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. at least, i don’t want to switch very soon.now coming to the phone. i have got this for rs. 34000/- during the big billion day sale.battery: my main concern was the battery, and this is the reason i didn’t go for s23 fe, which was available at almost the same price. the battery in the a55 is better than the one in s23 fe. in fact, i would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. it gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. i charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. the battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.build quality: the reason i didn’t go for the a35. both are designed the same, but the a55 has an aluminium frame. it makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. i admit that the aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. and i intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.display: i think i don’t need to say much about samsung’s display. it has a 120hz samoled screen, which is very beautiful. you can limit the refresh rate to 60hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.update policy: samsung promises to provide 4 years of android updates and 5 years of security updates. i think samsung will keep their promise, and i will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.camera: camera isn’t one of the usps of this phone, mostly for the redundant macro sensor. the macro sensor isn’t very good. they could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the s23 fe. the 50mp main camera and the 12mp ultrawide lens is good. low light photography is also very good with this camera. i guess its not possible to upgrade a macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.adaptability: last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. you will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.the samsung galaxy a55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.read more;

i am using samsung after a long time. especially, i have never used samsung android before. and now i don’t want to use other android phones at all. one ui is really a charm. lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean ui, that’s what i can tell about samsung’s one ui, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. now i understand why people who used samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. at least, i don’t want to switch very soon.now coming to the phone. i have got this for rs. 34000/- during the big billion day sale.battery: my main concern was the battery, and this is the reason i didn’t go for s23 fe, which was available at almost the same price. the battery in the a55 is better than the one in s23 fe. in fact, i would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. it gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. i charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. the battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.build quality: the reason i didn’t go for the a35. both are designed the same, but the a55 has an aluminium frame. it makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. i admit that the aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. and i intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.display: i think i don’t need to say much about samsung’s display. it has a 120hz samoled screen, which is very beautiful. you can limit the refresh rate to 60hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.update policy: samsung promises to provide 4 years of android updates and 5 years of security updates. i think samsung will keep their promise, and i will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.camera: camera isn’t one of the usps of this phone, mostly for the redundant macro sensor. the macro sensor isn’t very good. they could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the s23 fe. the 50mp main camera and the 12mp ultrawide lens is good. low light photography is also very good with this camera. i guess its not possible to upgrade a macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.adaptability: last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. you will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.the samsung galaxy a55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.read more;

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

great phone with crazy performance.the only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in t3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi. and about codm,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. crazy good phone for codm. for fc mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. the lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. for codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed b in coastal s&d and 4 players were camping there. in fc mobile no drops straight up 60. crazy performance. the cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. so if you want natural photo than it's not good. display is crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. one more thing that is annoying is the ui, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy. videography and ui is the only downside of this phone.want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.read more;

dear tech enthusiast,i recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and i felt compelled to share my impressions. in a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. however, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.the phone i'm referring to is the iqoo neo 10r. priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.here's a breakdown of my experience:performance: at the heart of this device lies the snapdragon 8s gen 3 chipset. this powerful processor, coupled with 8gb of ram, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like bgmi and cod mobile at high settings. i was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. the antutu gpu score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.display: the 6.78-inch amoled display with a 144hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. the colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. while the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.gaming features: iqoo has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the neo 10r. it boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in fps meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'monster mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. the inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.battery: the 6400mah battery is a significant highlight. it easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. even after intense gaming sessions, i was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.other notable aspects:* the phone supports 5g connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* it features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. the 50mp main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* the software experience is clean and optimized for performance.areas for potential improvement:* while the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* the camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.overall:the iqoo neo 10r offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. while there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. if gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iqoo neo 10r deserves a serious look.sincerely,a satisfied mobile gamer.read more;

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

battery also drained fast due to buffering & searching the network. swiped the sims with another 5g phones also to get the accurate solution which got positively correct. the ringtone volume also goes zero automatically & i was not able to hear the ringtone only to see several missed calls! hence i decided to go for moto edge 50 fusion.. believe me friends, all my problems & complaints got solved. writing this review after 60 days of experience. also, moto's build quality is excellent, 144hz curved glass display, vegan leather back finish, weight, minimal blotware, user friendly interface, camera with sony lenses, future sequrity updates makes this phone- the best flagship brand in this segment. one more thing i want to mention here is that, the phone & its charging accessories have a soothing fragrance which gives you a fresh feel. vegan leather back finish is just awesome. it gives you a non slippery handling no matter its in your hand or on the dashboard of your car. i didn't find any lags during past two months of use with the snapdragon processor. speed, accuracy and functionality is great if compared with poco x6, redmi, vivo or any other similar samsung galaxy phones. totally peace of mind purchase i must say. thanks motorola for such a beautiful experience & thanks amazon for the best deal.👍read more; i was facing issues with network, disturbance in calling & internet speed in my poco x6 5g smartphone since day one!

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

(to experience true 90fps gaming you need to turn on the gt mode).2)performance:- gaming phones generally do perform well on normal usage too, same here, the processor was good enough and runs smoothly even on multitasking. (can give a max of 120hz refresh rate). performance wise no doubt, you will be satisfied!3)design and display: the 6.67 inch oled display was really good and appreciable!4)camera:- although primarily this was not a camera phone but still the picture quality was fine and good, with a 50mp back camera and 16mp front camera (back camera was better though).5)battery:- battery backup was good, comes with a 45w supervoc uf inbox charger, takes almost 1 hr 20 mins to charge fully from zero. can give a full working day backup on normal usage.6) sound quality:- sound quality was fine, the stereo speakers are loud and clear, for calls they've included clear voice(enc) feature too.(there was no dolby atmos btw, should 've included it! :)7) comfort in hand: trust me, this mobile is really comfortable in hand while holding and gaming. you don't feel any slipperiness.cons:-1) the main problem i personally experienced is 'overheating', like wtf man it goes till 42.5°c while charging and 41°c while gaming at a room temperature of 30 degrees!!2) too much bloatware from the app market (although you can clear it).3) build quality/looks:-  the built quality can be improved, both frame and back comes with a plastic material and no gorrila glass too:)4) should also have included nfc tap to pay or gorrila glass as most phone's at this price are providing any one of them.5) antutu scores: when i ran antutu test, it scored nearly 670k (btw they've said 750k)👎🏻. although 670k was a good score, it was much lesser than what they've said(750k).final verdict: this phone was mainly focused on gaming and performance, if you are a mobile gamer or need a good performance mobile, you can go for it. if you prefer good camera and build quality/design this  might not be a better choice for you!!this phone worked well for me!! i advice you to check other reviews too:)read more; my ratings 4.45/5⭐okay! i'm writing this review after one month of usage. i played bgmi and ff, ran antutu test and cpu throttling too..pros:-1) gaming:-  no doubt that this is the best phone for gaming at this price segment, i played both ff and bgmi on this device, the dimensity 7300 processor runs so smoothly so that you can experience a lag free gaming even in high graphics/resolution.

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

dear tech enthusiast,i recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and i felt compelled to share my impressions. in a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. however, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.the phone i'm referring to is the iqoo neo 10r. priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.here's a breakdown of my experience:performance: at the heart of this device lies the snapdragon 8s gen 3 chipset. this powerful processor, coupled with 8gb of ram, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like bgmi and cod mobile at high settings. i was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. the antutu gpu score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.display: the 6.78-inch amoled display with a 144hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. the colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. while the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.gaming features: iqoo has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the neo 10r. it boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in fps meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'monster mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. the inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.battery: the 6400mah battery is a significant highlight. it easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. even after intense gaming sessions, i was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.other notable aspects:* the phone supports 5g connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* it features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. the 50mp main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* the software experience is clean and optimized for performance.areas for potential improvement:* while the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* the camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.overall:the iqoo neo 10r offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. while there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. if gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iqoo neo 10r deserves a serious look.sincerely,a satisfied mobile gamer.read more;

i had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations. the functioning and screen is excellent . it has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. the battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. the device features quick charging functionality. the display quality is good. during the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. the phone doesn't have an ip certification due to which contact with water might damage it. this purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.read more;

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

buying the tecno pova 6 neo for ₹13,999 feels like a waste, especially with the misleading claims about the ai camera. the phone only supports 16 ai-generated photos and doesn’t offer 4k video recording. it has a 108mp rear camera, but no additional lenses, limiting its ability to take different types of photos. the front camera pictures also lose quality when zoomed in, which isn’t great.on top of that, the phone doesn’t have gorilla glass or any other protective screen, making it easy to scratch. even though it has a 5000mah battery, it doesn’t last a full day, and the 18w charging is slow, with noticeable heating issues when charging.the camera doesn’t perform well in low light, so night photography is disappointing. the phone also heats up during gaming, which affects its performance. without electronic image stabilization (eis), videos aren’t very stable, especially when moving or shooting handheld.the 6.67-inch lcd screen, with a resolution of 1600x720 pixels (hd+), is below average, and it doesn’t look as clear as other phones in this price range. even though tecno claims the phone has a 120hz refresh rate, scrolling through apps like youtube, instagram, and facebook feels laggy after using it for a while.tecno also advertises a 12-month ottplay subscription with a scratch code included in the box, but the code doesn’t work after just a month, which is frustrating.the phone has dual stereo speakers with dolby atmos, but the sound during whatsapp video calls or on loudspeaker isn’t as loud as expected. for the price, this kind of quality just isn’t good enough.read more;

i am using samsung after a long time. especially, i have never used samsung android before. and now i don’t want to use other android phones at all. one ui is really a charm. lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean ui, that’s what i can tell about samsung’s one ui, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. now i understand why people who used samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. at least, i don’t want to switch very soon.now coming to the phone. i have got this for rs. 34000/- during the big billion day sale.battery: my main concern was the battery, and this is the reason i didn’t go for s23 fe, which was available at almost the same price. the battery in the a55 is better than the one in s23 fe. in fact, i would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. it gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. i charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. the battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.build quality: the reason i didn’t go for the a35. both are designed the same, but the a55 has an aluminium frame. it makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. i admit that the aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. and i intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.display: i think i don’t need to say much about samsung’s display. it has a 120hz samoled screen, which is very beautiful. you can limit the refresh rate to 60hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.update policy: samsung promises to provide 4 years of android updates and 5 years of security updates. i think samsung will keep their promise, and i will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.camera: camera isn’t one of the usps of this phone, mostly for the redundant macro sensor. the macro sensor isn’t very good. they could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the s23 fe. the 50mp main camera and the 12mp ultrawide lens is good. low light photography is also very good with this camera. i guess its not possible to upgrade a macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.adaptability: last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. you will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.the samsung galaxy a55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.read more;

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

dear tech enthusiast,i recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and i felt compelled to share my impressions. in a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. however, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.the phone i'm referring to is the iqoo neo 10r. priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.here's a breakdown of my experience:performance: at the heart of this device lies the snapdragon 8s gen 3 chipset. this powerful processor, coupled with 8gb of ram, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like bgmi and cod mobile at high settings. i was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. the antutu gpu score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.display: the 6.78-inch amoled display with a 144hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. the colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. while the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.gaming features: iqoo has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the neo 10r. it boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in fps meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'monster mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. the inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.battery: the 6400mah battery is a significant highlight. it easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. even after intense gaming sessions, i was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.other notable aspects:* the phone supports 5g connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* it features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. the 50mp main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* the software experience is clean and optimized for performance.areas for potential improvement:* while the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* the camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.overall:the iqoo neo 10r offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. while there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. if gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iqoo neo 10r deserves a serious look.sincerely,a satisfied mobile gamer.read more;

i had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations. the functioning and screen is excellent . it has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. the battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. the device features quick charging functionality. the display quality is good. during the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. the phone doesn't have an ip certification due to which contact with water might damage it. this purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.read more;

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

i am using samsung after a long time. especially, i have never used samsung android before. and now i don’t want to use other android phones at all. one ui is really a charm. lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean ui, that’s what i can tell about samsung’s one ui, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. now i understand why people who used samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. at least, i don’t want to switch very soon.now coming to the phone. i have got this for rs. 34000/- during the big billion day sale.battery: my main concern was the battery, and this is the reason i didn’t go for s23 fe, which was available at almost the same price. the battery in the a55 is better than the one in s23 fe. in fact, i would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. it gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. i charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. the battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.build quality: the reason i didn’t go for the a35. both are designed the same, but the a55 has an aluminium frame. it makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. i admit that the aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. and i intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.display: i think i don’t need to say much about samsung’s display. it has a 120hz samoled screen, which is very beautiful. you can limit the refresh rate to 60hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.update policy: samsung promises to provide 4 years of android updates and 5 years of security updates. i think samsung will keep their promise, and i will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.camera: camera isn’t one of the usps of this phone, mostly for the redundant macro sensor. the macro sensor isn’t very good. they could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the s23 fe. the 50mp main camera and the 12mp ultrawide lens is good. low light photography is also very good with this camera. i guess its not possible to upgrade a macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.adaptability: last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. you will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.the samsung galaxy a55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.read more;

i recently purchased the oneplus nord ce 4 lite, and it has truly exceeded my expectations, deserving a solid 5-star rating. here’s a detailed breakdown of why this phone is an excellent choice:design and build quality: the oneplus nord ce 4 lite boasts a sleek, modern design with a premium feel. the materials used are top-notch, giving it a solid and durable build. its slim profile and lightweight nature make it comfortable to hold and use for extended periods.display: the phone features a stunning amoled display with vibrant colors and sharp resolution. whether watching videos, playing games, or browsing the web, the visuals are crisp and clear. the high refresh rate adds to the smoothness of the experience, making every interaction buttery smooth.performance: powered by the qualcomm snapdragon 695 soc, the oneplus nord ce 4 lite handles everything with ease. from multitasking to running graphic-intensive games, it performs without a hitch. while the processor might not be the latest, it still delivers reliable performance for daily use.camera: the camera setup is impressive, especially the 50mp main sensor, which captures detailed and vibrant photos even in low light. the wide-angle lens adds versatility, allowing for creative shots. the video recording quality is also top-notch, with stable and clear footage. however, low-light photography could use some improvement.battery life: battery life is outstanding, easily lasting a full day with moderate to heavy use. the 5,500mah battery ensures you won’t run out of juice during the day. the fast charging feature is a lifesaver, allowing you to quickly top up the battery when needed.additional features: the phone has an official ip54 certification for protection against water splashes and dust. the design, inspired by minimalist tones and patterns, gives it a premium look. the 3.5mm audio jack is a bonus for wired earphone users.in conclusion, the oneplus nord ce 4 lite is an excellent smartphone in its price segment. its design, display, performance, and battery life make it a worthy contender. while it could benefit from a newer processor and improved low-light camera performance, it still offers great value for money. for daily usage, the nord ce 4 lite will not disappoint.read more;

i am writing this review after 1 month of using the oneplus nord 4. it is one of the best midrange phone that you can blindly buy without any confusion. i bought this phone during great indian festival after so much research and doubts. i was not sure which phone will be the best in 30000 segment. i was looking for a balanced phone which has everything like good performance, good design, good battery and good camera. i don't want to compromise in any one thing. so after lot of research i was having confusion between nord 4 and realme gt 6t. but in realme gt 6t the display is curved which i don't prefer at all. curved display is waste of money and feels like gimmick so i avoided it and bought nord 4. now i feel it was the best decision.best features of this nord 4 are-design - i literally loved the mercurian silver metel design which looks so much premium. i thought metel might be heavier but in daily use its not a problem at all. it cools down so fast and does not have any heating issues at all.performance - it has the best performance and able to play bgmi so smoothly. flat screen helps so much in games also.battery -  if you use normally the battery will last more than 1 day easily and it charges the phone within 25mins.camera - i felt the main camera is so good and it takes very decent photos. 50mp camera performs above average. if camera is your main priority then its better to go for realme, vivo, samsung or iphone which are camera centric. but then other areas you have to compromise. trust me below 30k this phone takes very good photos.network - being a metel phone i am getting 5g network always without any problem. never felt any issues at all.display - it has best display and content viewing experience is top notch with minimum bezzels.this review is genuine and trust me if you want a balanced midrange phone you can go for oneplus nord 4 for sure. greenline is coming in all the brands so no need to get back from this phone because of this reason....(if any problems comes in future then i will update the review for sure)read more;

(to experience true 90fps gaming you need to turn on the gt mode).2)performance:- gaming phones generally do perform well on normal usage too, same here, the processor was good enough and runs smoothly even on multitasking. (can give a max of 120hz refresh rate). performance wise no doubt, you will be satisfied!3)design and display: the 6.67 inch oled display was really good and appreciable!4)camera:- although primarily this was not a camera phone but still the picture quality was fine and good, with a 50mp back camera and 16mp front camera (back camera was better though).5)battery:- battery backup was good, comes with a 45w supervoc uf inbox charger, takes almost 1 hr 20 mins to charge fully from zero. can give a full working day backup on normal usage.6) sound quality:- sound quality was fine, the stereo speakers are loud and clear, for calls they've included clear voice(enc) feature too.(there was no dolby atmos btw, should 've included it! :)7) comfort in hand: trust me, this mobile is really comfortable in hand while holding and gaming. you don't feel any slipperiness.cons:-1) the main problem i personally experienced is 'overheating', like wtf man it goes till 42.5°c while charging and 41°c while gaming at a room temperature of 30 degrees!!2) too much bloatware from the app market (although you can clear it).3) build quality/looks:-  the built quality can be improved, both frame and back comes with a plastic material and no gorrila glass too:)4) should also have included nfc tap to pay or gorrila glass as most phone's at this price are providing any one of them.5) antutu scores: when i ran antutu test, it scored nearly 670k (btw they've said 750k)👎🏻. although 670k was a good score, it was much lesser than what they've said(750k).final verdict: this phone was mainly focused on gaming and performance, if you are a mobile gamer or need a good performance mobile, you can go for it. if you prefer good camera and build quality/design this  might not be a better choice for you!!this phone worked well for me!! i advice you to check other reviews too:)read more; my ratings 4.45/5⭐okay! i'm writing this review after one month of usage. i played bgmi and ff, ran antutu test and cpu throttling too..pros:-1) gaming:-  no doubt that this is the best phone for gaming at this price segment, i played both ff and bgmi on this device, the dimensity 7300 processor runs so smoothly so that you can experience a lag free gaming even in high graphics/resolution.

i am using samsung after a long time. especially, i have never used samsung android before. and now i don’t want to use other android phones at all. one ui is really a charm. lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean ui, that’s what i can tell about samsung’s one ui, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. now i understand why people who used samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. at least, i don’t want to switch very soon.now coming to the phone. i have got this for rs. 34000/- during the big billion day sale.battery: my main concern was the battery, and this is the reason i didn’t go for s23 fe, which was available at almost the same price. the battery in the a55 is better than the one in s23 fe. in fact, i would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. it gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. i charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. the battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.build quality: the reason i didn’t go for the a35. both are designed the same, but the a55 has an aluminium frame. it makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. i admit that the aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. and i intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.display: i think i don’t need to say much about samsung’s display. it has a 120hz samoled screen, which is very beautiful. you can limit the refresh rate to 60hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.update policy: samsung promises to provide 4 years of android updates and 5 years of security updates. i think samsung will keep their promise, and i will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.camera: camera isn’t one of the usps of this phone, mostly for the redundant macro sensor. the macro sensor isn’t very good. they could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the s23 fe. the 50mp main camera and the 12mp ultrawide lens is good. low light photography is also very good with this camera. i guess its not possible to upgrade a macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.adaptability: last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. you will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.the samsung galaxy a55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.read more;

this is really good if you're 20 to 30 metres away from birds/animals. you can use this to shoot nice pics / videos.please be warned that pictures come out like a mirrorless camera and the color science isn't like phones. that is a major reason you'll find most reviews to prefer vivo with their polished look. highlights on skin are supposed to stay if you shoot in direct sun and the sun isn't supposed to look round if you shoot it above 45 degrees. i love the fact that computational photography has been dialled down in this phone. you can always do those things in post with any good software. i hate the over processed look and this suffices for my case.leaving the camera aside, i'd say this is a really good battery for a flagship. i end the day with around 40 to 50 percent at times, and i'm a heavy user. i use a lot of camera; like a lot of it. i use a lot of youtube and instagram. i edit photos. i also listen to music at least 3 hours in a day while working. all thing combined i'm getting a screen on time of more than 8 hours.the phone is absolutely smooth and no complaints there. it's been a month and i've not faced even one stutter. i sold off my mi 11 ultra after 2 months of use due to multiple issues. it's not the case anymore. i don't see any polish difference between samsung and this phone. i can't relate to the fact that samsung makes a better experience. people keep talking about it, but i'm not sure i can relate. but yes, there are things i miss like samsung pay (google pay works on this one though), ultra wide band to search for my smart watch (i just let it ring now), a night mode on the camera (i think xiaomi has been over confident and has not included a night mode. i agree that shots come out really good even without one but including one would be good. and please include an astrophotography mode as well. all it has is auto night mode now. there's no dedicated mode).i can't find any other deterrents as of now. it's good for the priceread more; xiaomi has taken strides this time to make sure the camera works. i've been using samsung s22 ultra for 3.5 years before this and the immediate jump was highly visible.the main camera is amazing and works in every condition. i was surprised to see that night videos come out without noise and there are no luminous colorful noise dots on the video. the pictures you shoot are really good and after 3.5 years i've managed to take images of pets without the need to hold them still. the fastshot mode actually works. the 1.5x crop and 2x crop was magical. since the sensor is big, these crops make it feel like it's being shot with an actual 1.5 and 2x lens.the 3x tele, even if reviewers have always said is not good enough, is actually good and shoots really good portrait. actually all the lenses shoot really good portrait. the videos are also pretty balanced.the 4.3x is a literally a superbbbbb lens and you can literally shoot at 20 to 30x and find usable results. i was surprised at what this 'ai' tele can do!

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

best phone. looks and feels premium. but it's not for these gen z kids, ui and software is simple and clean. not much advanced features for gaming and tuning etc.phone is heating as common as other phones.battery life average for 5000mahvalue for money; i am using samsung after a long time. especially, i have never used samsung android before. and now i don’t want to use other android phones at all. one ui is really a charm. lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean ui, that’s what i can tell about samsung’s one ui, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. now i understand why people who used samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. at least, i don’t want to switch very soon.now coming to the phone. i have got this for rs. 34000/- during the big billion day sale.battery: my main concern was the battery, and this is the reason i didn’t go for s23 fe, which was available at almost the same price. the battery in the a55 is better than the one in s23 fe. in fact, i would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. it gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. i charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. the battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.build quality: the reason i didn’t go for the a35. both are designed the same, but the a55 has an aluminium frame. it makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. i admit that the aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. and i intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.display: i think i don’t need to say much about samsung’s display. it has a 120hz samoled screen, which is very beautiful. you can limit the refresh rate to 60hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.update policy: samsung promises to provide 4 years of android updates and 5 years of security updates. i think samsung will keep their promise, and i will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.camera: camera isn’t one of the usps of this phone, mostly for the redundant macro sensor. the macro sensor isn’t very good. they could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the s23 fe. the 50mp main camera and the 12mp ultrawide lens is good. low light photography is also very good with this camera. i guess its not possible to upgrade a macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.adaptability: last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. you will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.the samsung galaxy a55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.read more;

i am writing this review after 1 month of using the oneplus nord 4. it is one of the best midrange phone that you can blindly buy without any confusion. i bought this phone during great indian festival after so much research and doubts. i was not sure which phone will be the best in 30000 segment. i was looking for a balanced phone which has everything like good performance, good design, good battery and good camera. i don't want to compromise in any one thing. so after lot of research i was having confusion between nord 4 and realme gt 6t. but in realme gt 6t the display is curved which i don't prefer at all. curved display is waste of money and feels like gimmick so i avoided it and bought nord 4. now i feel it was the best decision.best features of this nord 4 are-design - i literally loved the mercurian silver metel design which looks so much premium. i thought metel might be heavier but in daily use its not a problem at all. it cools down so fast and does not have any heating issues at all.performance - it has the best performance and able to play bgmi so smoothly. flat screen helps so much in games also.battery -  if you use normally the battery will last more than 1 day easily and it charges the phone within 25mins.camera - i felt the main camera is so good and it takes very decent photos. 50mp camera performs above average. if camera is your main priority then its better to go for realme, vivo, samsung or iphone which are camera centric. but then other areas you have to compromise. trust me below 30k this phone takes very good photos.network - being a metel phone i am getting 5g network always without any problem. never felt any issues at all.display - it has best display and content viewing experience is top notch with minimum bezzels.this review is genuine and trust me if you want a balanced midrange phone you can go for oneplus nord 4 for sure. greenline is coming in all the brands so no need to get back from this phone because of this reason....(if any problems comes in future then i will update the review for sure)read more;

(to experience true 90fps gaming you need to turn on the gt mode).2)performance:- gaming phones generally do perform well on normal usage too, same here, the processor was good enough and runs smoothly even on multitasking. (can give a max of 120hz refresh rate). performance wise no doubt, you will be satisfied!3)design and display: the 6.67 inch oled display was really good and appreciable!4)camera:- although primarily this was not a camera phone but still the picture quality was fine and good, with a 50mp back camera and 16mp front camera (back camera was better though).5)battery:- battery backup was good, comes with a 45w supervoc uf inbox charger, takes almost 1 hr 20 mins to charge fully from zero. can give a full working day backup on normal usage.6) sound quality:- sound quality was fine, the stereo speakers are loud and clear, for calls they've included clear voice(enc) feature too.(there was no dolby atmos btw, should 've included it! :)7) comfort in hand: trust me, this mobile is really comfortable in hand while holding and gaming. you don't feel any slipperiness.cons:-1) the main problem i personally experienced is 'overheating', like wtf man it goes till 42.5°c while charging and 41°c while gaming at a room temperature of 30 degrees!!2) too much bloatware from the app market (although you can clear it).3) build quality/looks:-  the built quality can be improved, both frame and back comes with a plastic material and no gorrila glass too:)4) should also have included nfc tap to pay or gorrila glass as most phone's at this price are providing any one of them.5) antutu scores: when i ran antutu test, it scored nearly 670k (btw they've said 750k)👎🏻. although 670k was a good score, it was much lesser than what they've said(750k).final verdict: this phone was mainly focused on gaming and performance, if you are a mobile gamer or need a good performance mobile, you can go for it. if you prefer good camera and build quality/design this  might not be a better choice for you!!this phone worked well for me!! i advice you to check other reviews too:)read more; my ratings 4.45/5⭐okay! i'm writing this review after one month of usage. i played bgmi and ff, ran antutu test and cpu throttling too..pros:-1) gaming:-  no doubt that this is the best phone for gaming at this price segment, i played both ff and bgmi on this device, the dimensity 7300 processor runs so smoothly so that you can experience a lag free gaming even in high graphics/resolution.

dear tech enthusiast,i recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and i felt compelled to share my impressions. in a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. however, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.the phone i'm referring to is the iqoo neo 10r. priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.here's a breakdown of my experience:performance: at the heart of this device lies the snapdragon 8s gen 3 chipset. this powerful processor, coupled with 8gb of ram, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like bgmi and cod mobile at high settings. i was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. the antutu gpu score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.display: the 6.78-inch amoled display with a 144hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. the colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. while the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.gaming features: iqoo has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the neo 10r. it boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in fps meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'monster mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. the inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.battery: the 6400mah battery is a significant highlight. it easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. even after intense gaming sessions, i was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.other notable aspects:* the phone supports 5g connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* it features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. the 50mp main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* the software experience is clean and optimized for performance.areas for potential improvement:* while the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* the camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.overall:the iqoo neo 10r offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. while there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. if gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iqoo neo 10r deserves a serious look.sincerely,a satisfied mobile gamer.read more;

i had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations. the functioning and screen is excellent . it has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. the battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. the device features quick charging functionality. the display quality is good. during the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. the phone doesn't have an ip certification due to which contact with water might damage it. this purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.read more;

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

i am using samsung after a long time. especially, i have never used samsung android before. and now i don’t want to use other android phones at all. one ui is really a charm. lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean ui, that’s what i can tell about samsung’s one ui, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. now i understand why people who used samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. at least, i don’t want to switch very soon.now coming to the phone. i have got this for rs. 34000/- during the big billion day sale.battery: my main concern was the battery, and this is the reason i didn’t go for s23 fe, which was available at almost the same price. the battery in the a55 is better than the one in s23 fe. in fact, i would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. it gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. i charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. the battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.build quality: the reason i didn’t go for the a35. both are designed the same, but the a55 has an aluminium frame. it makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. i admit that the aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. and i intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.display: i think i don’t need to say much about samsung’s display. it has a 120hz samoled screen, which is very beautiful. you can limit the refresh rate to 60hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.update policy: samsung promises to provide 4 years of android updates and 5 years of security updates. i think samsung will keep their promise, and i will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.camera: camera isn’t one of the usps of this phone, mostly for the redundant macro sensor. the macro sensor isn’t very good. they could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the s23 fe. the 50mp main camera and the 12mp ultrawide lens is good. low light photography is also very good with this camera. i guess its not possible to upgrade a macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.adaptability: last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. you will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.the samsung galaxy a55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.read more;

i’ve been using the samsung galaxy a36 for a while now, and here’s my honest take on it.the overall performance and design of the phone are solid. the display is vibrant, the ui is smooth for daily tasks, and the build feels premium for its price. it handles most apps and media consumption well, making it a decent phone for everyday use.however, there are a few noticeable downsides. the device tends to heat up quite a bit, especially during charging or while using demanding apps. speaking of charging, it’s slower than expected—even with the provided charger, it takes longer than most phones in the same range. the fingerprint sensor is another letdown. it's not very accurate or fast, and sometimes it doesn't work at all, which can be frustrating.despite the heating issues, slow charging, and unreliable fingerprint sensor, the phone still manages to deliver a good all-round experience. if you can overlook those flaws, the galaxy a36 is a decent option in the mid-range category.read more;

i've been using my new samsung device for a month now, and i’m genuinely impressed with how well it performs. despite the front camera being 12mp and the main one 50mp, the photo quality has exceeded my expectations. samsung’s image processing really makes a difference. the latest ui 7 is smooth, intuitive, and packed with useful features that enhance the overall experience.as someone who’s been a samsung user for over 10 years—my previous phone was the f62—i was initially hesitant about this purchase because of the price. a lot of people around me said it was too expensive. but now that i’ve used it, i can confidently say it’s worth every penny, especially if you’re someone who doesn’t game all day but needs a reliable, high-performing phone for personal or business use.one thing that truly surprised me was how fast the data transferred—everything moved over in under 6 minutes, and i was honestly shocked. i use samsung notes extensively and had over 1,200 notes, yet they were transferred flawlessly along with all my images and videos. that level of efficiency made the transition effortless.the charging speed is solid too. of course, like any device, battery life depends on usage. if you're running brightness at 90–100%, you'll need to recharge more often. while the phone doesn’t support expandable storage, the built-in 256gb is more than enough for most users—unless you're constantly vlogging or shooting 4k content.another huge advantage is the long-term value: this device comes with 6 years of os upgrades, which is rare in today’s smartphone market. that alone puts it ahead of many competitors and gives me confidence in its longevity.in short, i highly recommend this phone. it’s a powerful, future-proof choice that balances performance, design, and usability perfectly. don’t let the price talk scare you—it’s absolutely justified by what you’re getting in return.read more;

dear tech enthusiast,i recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and i felt compelled to share my impressions. in a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. however, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.the phone i'm referring to is the iqoo neo 10r. priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.here's a breakdown of my experience:performance: at the heart of this device lies the snapdragon 8s gen 3 chipset. this powerful processor, coupled with 8gb of ram, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like bgmi and cod mobile at high settings. i was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. the antutu gpu score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.display: the 6.78-inch amoled display with a 144hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. the colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. while the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.gaming features: iqoo has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the neo 10r. it boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in fps meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'monster mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. the inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.battery: the 6400mah battery is a significant highlight. it easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. even after intense gaming sessions, i was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.other notable aspects:* the phone supports 5g connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* it features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. the 50mp main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* the software experience is clean and optimized for performance.areas for potential improvement:* while the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* the camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.overall:the iqoo neo 10r offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. while there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. if gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iqoo neo 10r deserves a serious look.sincerely,a satisfied mobile gamer.read more;

after using this phone for last 3 months and here are obervations. first thing i did after getting the phone is turn off all software update due to fear of getting green line issue as reported by many users. second do not put any back cover or use any tempered glass as it blocks the heat tranfer which is also one of the main cause of green line. lastly do not use any fast charger as the phone is capable of recieving only 2 amp during charging and slows down charging due to heat generated during charging. . i am using only 1 amp charger. also set screen refresh rate to 60hz. the battery life of this phone is very good but battery is producing lot of heat and this phone does not have any cooling system and poor heat managment.  i also have iqoo z9x in our family which has same snapdragon 6 gen 1 chipset and bigger battery but it runs very cool.  huawei needs to work on heat management in their phone as nobody wants to spend 12k on new display. there is no call recording by default but you can use third party app like ""cube acr"" for call recording.camera is ok but has really good night mode but no ois which not acceptable at this price point. overall it's good phone but i am not sure if this phone will survice hot indian summer but so far it's working good.read more;

i am writing this review after 1 month of using the oneplus nord 4. it is one of the best midrange phone that you can blindly buy without any confusion. i bought this phone during great indian festival after so much research and doubts. i was not sure which phone will be the best in 30000 segment. i was looking for a balanced phone which has everything like good performance, good design, good battery and good camera. i don't want to compromise in any one thing. so after lot of research i was having confusion between nord 4 and realme gt 6t. but in realme gt 6t the display is curved which i don't prefer at all. curved display is waste of money and feels like gimmick so i avoided it and bought nord 4. now i feel it was the best decision.best features of this nord 4 are-design - i literally loved the mercurian silver metel design which looks so much premium. i thought metel might be heavier but in daily use its not a problem at all. it cools down so fast and does not have any heating issues at all.performance - it has the best performance and able to play bgmi so smoothly. flat screen helps so much in games also.battery -  if you use normally the battery will last more than 1 day easily and it charges the phone within 25mins.camera - i felt the main camera is so good and it takes very decent photos. 50mp camera performs above average. if camera is your main priority then its better to go for realme, vivo, samsung or iphone which are camera centric. but then other areas you have to compromise. trust me below 30k this phone takes very good photos.network - being a metel phone i am getting 5g network always without any problem. never felt any issues at all.display - it has best display and content viewing experience is top notch with minimum bezzels.this review is genuine and trust me if you want a balanced midrange phone you can go for oneplus nord 4 for sure. greenline is coming in all the brands so no need to get back from this phone because of this reason....(if any problems comes in future then i will update the review for sure)read more;

dear tech enthusiast,i recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and i felt compelled to share my impressions. in a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. however, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.the phone i'm referring to is the iqoo neo 10r. priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.here's a breakdown of my experience:performance: at the heart of this device lies the snapdragon 8s gen 3 chipset. this powerful processor, coupled with 8gb of ram, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like bgmi and cod mobile at high settings. i was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. the antutu gpu score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.display: the 6.78-inch amoled display with a 144hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. the colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. while the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.gaming features: iqoo has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the neo 10r. it boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in fps meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'monster mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. the inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.battery: the 6400mah battery is a significant highlight. it easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. even after intense gaming sessions, i was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.other notable aspects:* the phone supports 5g connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* it features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. the 50mp main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* the software experience is clean and optimized for performance.areas for potential improvement:* while the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* the camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.overall:the iqoo neo 10r offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. while there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. if gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iqoo neo 10r deserves a serious look.sincerely,a satisfied mobile gamer.read more;

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

first impressions:1. while it has a lcd display. it appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. although it's 120hz rr, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. there are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. battery backup is definitely its usp. having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. takes around 1.5 hours to fully charge.6. camera is nothing to brag about. it's a decent single shooter. no ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. all other phones are offering mtk6100 while it has sd6gen1 which definitely performs better. and there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.overall, a very solid phone in the price range.update: one star deducted - the camera quality is abysmal. there is no optimization done on the camera. colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. with light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. a capable set of speakers. while they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.read more;

i am using samsung after a long time. especially, i have never used samsung android before. and now i don’t want to use other android phones at all. one ui is really a charm. lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean ui, that’s what i can tell about samsung’s one ui, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. now i understand why people who used samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. at least, i don’t want to switch very soon.now coming to the phone. i have got this for rs. 34000/- during the big billion day sale.battery: my main concern was the battery, and this is the reason i didn’t go for s23 fe, which was available at almost the same price. the battery in the a55 is better than the one in s23 fe. in fact, i would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. it gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. i charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. the battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.build quality: the reason i didn’t go for the a35. both are designed the same, but the a55 has an aluminium frame. it makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. i admit that the aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. and i intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.display: i think i don’t need to say much about samsung’s display. it has a 120hz samoled screen, which is very beautiful. you can limit the refresh rate to 60hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.update policy: samsung promises to provide 4 years of android updates and 5 years of security updates. i think samsung will keep their promise, and i will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.camera: camera isn’t one of the usps of this phone, mostly for the redundant macro sensor. the macro sensor isn’t very good. they could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the s23 fe. the 50mp main camera and the 12mp ultrawide lens is good. low light photography is also very good with this camera. i guess its not possible to upgrade a macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.adaptability: last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. you will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.the samsung galaxy a55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.read more;

i am using samsung after a long time. especially, i have never used samsung android before. and now i don’t want to use other android phones at all. one ui is really a charm. lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean ui, that’s what i can tell about samsung’s one ui, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. now i understand why people who used samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. at least, i don’t want to switch very soon.now coming to the phone. i have got this for rs. 34000/- during the big billion day sale.battery: my main concern was the battery, and this is the reason i didn’t go for s23 fe, which was available at almost the same price. the battery in the a55 is better than the one in s23 fe. in fact, i would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. it gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. i charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. the battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.build quality: the reason i didn’t go for the a35. both are designed the same, but the a55 has an aluminium frame. it makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. i admit that the aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. and i intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.display: i think i don’t need to say much about samsung’s display. it has a 120hz samoled screen, which is very beautiful. you can limit the refresh rate to 60hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.update policy: samsung promises to provide 4 years of android updates and 5 years of security updates. i think samsung will keep their promise, and i will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.camera: camera isn’t one of the usps of this phone, mostly for the redundant macro sensor. the macro sensor isn’t very good. they could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the s23 fe. the 50mp main camera and the 12mp ultrawide lens is good. low light photography is also very good with this camera. i guess its not possible to upgrade a macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.adaptability: last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. you will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.the samsung galaxy a55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.read more;

dear tech enthusiast,i recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and i felt compelled to share my impressions. in a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. however, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.the phone i'm referring to is the iqoo neo 10r. priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.here's a breakdown of my experience:performance: at the heart of this device lies the snapdragon 8s gen 3 chipset. this powerful processor, coupled with 8gb of ram, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like bgmi and cod mobile at high settings. i was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. the antutu gpu score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.display: the 6.78-inch amoled display with a 144hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. the colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. while the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.gaming features: iqoo has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the neo 10r. it boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in fps meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'monster mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. the inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.battery: the 6400mah battery is a significant highlight. it easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. even after intense gaming sessions, i was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.other notable aspects:* the phone supports 5g connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* it features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. the 50mp main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* the software experience is clean and optimized for performance.areas for potential improvement:* while the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* the camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.overall:the iqoo neo 10r offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. while there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. if gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iqoo neo 10r deserves a serious look.sincerely,a satisfied mobile gamer.read more;

priority is the camera. i have judged the camera harshly because cameras are important in flagships.edit 1: a second update addressed some of the issues in the camera and fixed it. some of the issues still remain (like overprocessing of photos indoors) but camera performs slightly better now so i'll increase the camera rating. kudos to oneplus for the prompt action.display - 7.5/10camera - 7.5/10performance - 9/10software - 8/10battery - 9.5/10connectivity - 9/10i upgraded from my op9r to this and got a nice exchange bonus out of it. i had briefly used a pixel 8 pro as well, and while the software and camera were superior than the op12, their hardware was outdated and i faced a lot of connectivity issues so i ended up returning the p8p.note: i will say that when it comes to the overall phone experience and my personal requirements, oneplus 12 is better than pixel 8 pro in my opinion and also ₹35k cheaper.this phone is already competitively priced so i got a good deal out of it. here are my initial impressions -1. accessories: getting a charger and a phone case in 2024 out of the box makes me really happy. the case is okay but i would recommend getting a better one. the charger is big and heavy as it's 100w.2. display: the display is - clarity and quality wise fantastic, and any media you play in a higher resolution will look phenomenal. the brightness is also quite ample even under full sunlight conditions.  although 4500 nits is misleading but when you access hdr content, you will witness it's not entirely a gimmick. a display this good at this price is commendable.the display is also curved, which is worst thing about it. this is the first curved display phone i've used and it's a bad experience for me. the light glares on the curved parts break the immersion while watching videos or browsing, photo editing can be a pain, causes problems in copy-pasting texts, gathers a lot of dust and not to mention how they are susceptible to more damages even with a good case on. it gets worse in sunlight. it will take some getting used to but i will never like it.3. camera: camera has good clarity (the 10-bit mode can further enhance picture quality) but is also frustrating at times. there are a lot of moments when it overexposes, over sharpens and messes up the white balance in certain parts of photos after processing. i've had to manually tweak the exposure settings to get the scenes right a lot of times. rear camera seflies indoors, sky pictures and sceneries with a lot of dynamic range come out weird after processing sometimes. the whole point of hasselblad tuning is that the photos should be true-to-life. sometimes pictures come out too warm indoors. outdoors they perform better. i have had to use the master mode on auto to take some pictures so that the processing does not ruin the picture. the downside of master mode is that your photos will end up looking a bit bland (because there's no post-processing happening) and it does not handle dynamic ranges well.quick tip: turn off the proxdr mode from the inbuilt gallery settings. it exaggerates photo quality on your display but is useless outside your gallery once you upload those photos somewhere.night mode is okay and gets the job done but don't expect it to perform a miracle with bad lighting conditions. portrait mode is fantastic, edge-detection is very well-tuned. the pro mode is where this camera shines and makes the use of the camera hardware but the majority won't use it. the glass coating on the camera is very susceptible to damage because it covers a better part of your phone's back so you will need to buy a good case.digital zoom is not very good in my opinion considering iqoo 12 has done a much better job with it while being significantly cheaper.video recordings from the rear camera come out clear enough and the audio quality is also good. but when you're switching lenses for zooming in, you'll notice a bit of stutter and a slight change in the colour gradient. when you're zooming in a lot, the camera takes 3-5 seconds before registering a focus object and detecting it properly. super stable mode works well but only with 60fps. 30fps recording mode is not that smooth, with sub-par stabilization and stutters a lot when switching lenses. these have been an ongoing issue for a few generations and one would have expected op to resolve it by now.front camera is pretty average (even more disappointing indoors). it works well in daylight but indoor pictures look like they're taken from a mid-range phone. they did tune the front camera to have a wider angle which is good. video recording from the front camera doesn't allow 60 fps but allows 4k recording now.op clearly needs to work in the camera department in future updates. their camera algorithms are quite behind compared to the current industry standards even though the phone has good camera hardware.overall camera is okay for daily use but if it's your main priority, this phone might not be for you.4. connectivity and call quality - did not notice any call drops, 5g works well and the person on the other end heard my voice very loud and clear. bluetooth and wifi are working well.ir blaster works but don't expect it to be compatible with every device. gets the job done regardless and a super convenient feature that i wish more phones had these days.5. battery and charging - it is fantastic. can last a full day on medium to heavy usage, and 1.5 days on light usage. they have also introduced battery health management features which is an added bonus. i had to try really hard to drain the battery completely.charging time is 25-27 mins after full drainage. the smart charging feature to conserve battery health over time is a nice addition. haven't used the wireless charging or reverse wireless charging so wouldn't be able to comment on it.my current sot shows up as almost 9 hrs and 1d 5 hrs since last charge with 7% charge left. battery is crazy good as you can see.6. performance: top-notch performance, phone feels super fast and snappy. got only slightly warm during gaming (i played codm), continuous camera operations and charging. their new cooling system is proving to be very good.read and write speeds, app installations are also super fast.7. software: oxygen os 14 has some very good parts (quick launch, smart sidebar, file docker etc), and some bad parts. there are some android 14 features that have not been implemented correctly (why do i have to manually set refresh rates for all the apps even after selecting the high refresh rate option?) or are absent (where are the lock screen customisations?). oos14 is still proving to be a good experience for me overall.i have not encountered any bugs in my day to day usage and every operation on the phone has been seamless so far. honestly, i expected op12 to be quite buggy at launch but i'm happy that they are learning from their mistakes.op has managed to give great features in an extremely competitive price and i would say i'm mostly happy with my purchase (except maybe the camera). china models will see ai features soon and i hope global launches follow the suit.read more; tldr; great phone for buyers who are looking for a well-rounded phone which can do a bit of everything, but don't buy it if your top priority is the camera. i have judged the camera harshly because cameras are important in flagships.edit 1: a second update addressed some of the issues in the camera and fixed it. some of the issues still remain (like overprocessing of photos indoors) but camera performs slightly better now so i'll increase the camera rating. kudos to oneplus for the prompt action.display - 7.5/10camera - 7.5/10performance - 9/10software - 8/10battery - 9.5/10connectivity - 9/10i upgraded from my op9r to this and got a nice exchange bonus out of it. i had briefly used a pixel 8 pro as well, and while the software and camera were superior than the op12, their hardware was outdated and i faced a lot of connectivity issues so i ended up returning the p8p.note: i will say that when it comes to the overall phone experience and my personal requirements, oneplus 12 is better than pixel 8 pro in my opinion and also ₹35k cheaper.this phone is already competitively priced so i got a good deal out of it. here are my initial impressions -1. accessories: getting a charger and a phone case in 2024 out of the box makes me really happy. the case is okay but i would recommend getting a better one. the charger is big and heavy as it's 100w.2. display: the display is - clarity and quality wise fantastic, and any media you play in a higher resolution will look phenomenal. the brightness is also quite ample even under full sunlight conditions.  although 4500 nits is misleading but when you access hdr content, you will witness it's not entirely a gimmick. a display this good at this price is commendable.the display is also curved, which is worst thing about it. this is the first curved display phone i've used and it's a bad experience for me. the light glares on the curved parts break the immersion while watching videos or browsing, photo editing can be a pain, causes problems in copy-pasting texts, gathers a lot of dust and not to mention how they are susceptible to more damages even with a good case on. it gets worse in sunlight. it will take some getting used to but i will never like it.3. camera: camera has good clarity (the 10-bit mode can further enhance picture quality) but is also frustrating at times. there are a lot of moments when it overexposes, over sharpens and messes up the white balance in certain parts of photos after processing. i've had to manually tweak the exposure settings to get the scenes right a lot of times. rear camera seflies indoors, sky pictures and sceneries with a lot of dynamic range come out weird after processing sometimes. the whole point of hasselblad tuning is that the photos should be true-to-life. sometimes pictures come out too warm indoors. outdoors they perform better. i have had to use the master mode on auto to take some pictures so that the processing does not ruin the picture. the downside of master mode is that your photos will end up looking a bit bland (because there's no post-processing happening) and it does not handle dynamic ranges well.quick tip: turn off the proxdr mode from the inbuilt gallery settings. it exaggerates photo quality on your display but is useless outside your gallery once you upload those photos somewhere.night mode is okay and gets the job done but don't expect it to perform a miracle with bad lighting conditions. portrait mode is fantastic, edge-detection is very well-tuned. the pro mode is where this camera shines and makes the use of the camera hardware but the majority won't use it. the glass coating on the camera is very susceptible to damage because it covers a better part of your

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

i am using samsung after a long time. especially, i have never used samsung android before. and now i don’t want to use other android phones at all. one ui is really a charm. lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean ui, that’s what i can tell about samsung’s one ui, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. now i understand why people who used samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. at least, i don’t want to switch very soon.now coming to the phone. i have got this for rs. 34000/- during the big billion day sale.battery: my main concern was the battery, and this is the reason i didn’t go for s23 fe, which was available at almost the same price. the battery in the a55 is better than the one in s23 fe. in fact, i would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. it gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. i charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. the battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.build quality: the reason i didn’t go for the a35. both are designed the same, but the a55 has an aluminium frame. it makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. i admit that the aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. and i intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.display: i think i don’t need to say much about samsung’s display. it has a 120hz samoled screen, which is very beautiful. you can limit the refresh rate to 60hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.update policy: samsung promises to provide 4 years of android updates and 5 years of security updates. i think samsung will keep their promise, and i will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.camera: camera isn’t one of the usps of this phone, mostly for the redundant macro sensor. the macro sensor isn’t very good. they could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the s23 fe. the 50mp main camera and the 12mp ultrawide lens is good. low light photography is also very good with this camera. i guess its not possible to upgrade a macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.adaptability: last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. you will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.the samsung galaxy a55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.read more;

i bought this phone recently and because my previous phone was also based on exynos and it definitely had lower internet  and hotspot speed when compared even to cheaper phone of that time i was quite scared that the same thing will happen again. and sadly, my fears were right. the first thing i did was compare internet speed with my other phone and the speed was less than half of what was in other phone. these two times can't be a coincidence. i tried everything to accont for any error. i even exchanged the sims even though both were jio, so that i am 100% sure.there is definitely some problem with exynos processor and internet speeds but i didn't know the drop would be less than half of what others are giving.also there are genuine heating issues. even for day to day task it would heat up. i knew about heating issues in exynos but thought it was a premium flagship phone and my usage is quite light so it wouldn't make a difference. but, it did make a difference. even on a 5-10 minues call it would heat up and become uncomfortable.really feel cheated out of my money this time. i guess there is a reason they don't sell exynos in usa and china. also there is  reason there was no exynos in s23 series and neither it is in s25.once you buy the product can only be replaced and not returned, so you will be stuck with a smartphone where the most basic and the most critical function of a stable and fast internet itself is not there. plus heating issues even on basic tasks will lead to throttling and slowing down ruining your experience.it is definitely not worth the money even on a huge discount which would be coming as i don't think otherwise anybody would buy it.the whole purpose of me writing this review (i generally don't review products) is to feel at least some sense of comfort that somebody else may not lose his/her money like i did, reading my review.if you want samsung only - go for s23 series or s25 or s24 ultra but at all cost avoid exynos processor. they are definitely, with multiple, and over the years, empirical evidence have significantly (not just slightly) poor and unstable internet speeds and really bad heating problems and it doesn't matter what is the pattern of your usage and these reviewers on youtube dont' tell us that.my speed test data: on snapdragon with jio5g - upto 140, always 100 mbps + ;

dear tech enthusiast,i recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and i felt compelled to share my impressions. in a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. however, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.the phone i'm referring to is the iqoo neo 10r. priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.here's a breakdown of my experience:performance: at the heart of this device lies the snapdragon 8s gen 3 chipset. this powerful processor, coupled with 8gb of ram, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like bgmi and cod mobile at high settings. i was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. the antutu gpu score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.display: the 6.78-inch amoled display with a 144hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. the colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. while the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.gaming features: iqoo has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the neo 10r. it boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in fps meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'monster mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. the inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.battery: the 6400mah battery is a significant highlight. it easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. even after intense gaming sessions, i was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.other notable aspects:* the phone supports 5g connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* it features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. the 50mp main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* the software experience is clean and optimized for performance.areas for potential improvement:* while the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* the camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.overall:the iqoo neo 10r offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. while there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. if gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iqoo neo 10r deserves a serious look.sincerely,a satisfied mobile gamer.read more;

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

initially i got a defective product, which was not charging at all even after keeping on charge for 5 hours. i spoke with amazon representative regarding the issue and they were quick enough to issue a replacement unit. i was skeptical about the replacement unit as well based on the already mentioned reviews but i am quite happy after receiving the new unit.i bought this for my mother, she was using the older jio phone. it's display was almost not visible and charging status was not showing. this felt like a good upgrade as i saw some reviews on youtube mentioning this doesn't lag much like earlier phones.so i bought this and feels it is worth. although its price seems a lil over 300-800 more but i think from what it's offering, if you use all those features then it is a good deal, although my mother uses the phone mostly to call and now to video call sometimes. battery is pretty good for such usage and it lasted almost 3 days with minimal to moderate usage which is very good.i watched youtube videos, live match in jio cinema, played some music in jio saavn and also that wireless radio feature is a very good addition, there isn't much lag considering its size and form factor, i liked the video plaback quality and sound, it is good enough.saw so much of negative reviews for this one, may be some products are defective like the first one which i received but felt this doesn't deserve that. that's why wrote this longgg review!read more;

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

great phone with crazy performance.the only con of this phone is, the videography. 4k 60fps is decent the it doesn't have the crisp that other phones have, so if you are buying a phone for content creation and vlogging, skip this one.other than the performance is crazy, the performance in bgmi is 85-90 fps in high tier classic matches, 86-90 fps in tdms, 75-90 fps in t3 customs and about the 120 fps is good in tdm easily 110-115 fps, but don't play for prolong or classic in 120 fps as it starts heating and stucks on 60 fps few minutes later, so stick to 90 fps. 90 fps is great in bgmi. and about codm,120 is crazy, constant 110-115 fps in codm no heating issues as the game is pretty optimised. crazy good phone for codm. for fc mobile it gives constant 60 fps in highest resolutions no lag smooth gameplay. the lowest fps drops i got for bgmi was 83 in classic in main event 42 players were around and in tdm 86 but it instantly went to 90 again and in compi around 75, because it was last zone around 30 players in miramar. for codm the highest drop was 109 after i rushed b in coastal s&d and 4 players were camping there. in fc mobile no drops straight up 60. crazy performance. the cameras are good potrait are clear and crisp, but i don't know why but i felt it enhances the colours and textures. so if you want natural photo than it's not good. display is crazy like really good colours, after performance the crazy thing about this phone have to be the display crazy colours and crazy visuals. one more thing that is annoying is the ui, a little bit too much bloatwares that you can't delete. good value for money phone if you are considering content consumption and performance, cameras are decent being a performance phone and still having these cameras are crazy. videography and ui is the only downside of this phone.want to do gaming and watch movies, this is the best phone in this segment to give you the flagship experience.read more;

dear tech enthusiast,i recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and i felt compelled to share my impressions. in a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. however, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.the phone i'm referring to is the iqoo neo 10r. priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.here's a breakdown of my experience:performance: at the heart of this device lies the snapdragon 8s gen 3 chipset. this powerful processor, coupled with 8gb of ram, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like bgmi and cod mobile at high settings. i was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. the antutu gpu score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.display: the 6.78-inch amoled display with a 144hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. the colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. while the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.gaming features: iqoo has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the neo 10r. it boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in fps meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'monster mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. the inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.battery: the 6400mah battery is a significant highlight. it easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. even after intense gaming sessions, i was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.other notable aspects:* the phone supports 5g connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* it features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. the 50mp main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* the software experience is clean and optimized for performance.areas for potential improvement:* while the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* the camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.overall:the iqoo neo 10r offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. while there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. if gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iqoo neo 10r deserves a serious look.sincerely,a satisfied mobile gamer.read more;

the media could not be loaded.it's been 5m since i bought this phone had a great experience, switched from iqoo neo 6 and this upgrade is worth it if you want best performance and overall good camera, the photos are really good as it's vivo's sub brand so the image pipeline is really good just vibrant on some occasions but you will not be disappointed. and the video quality is the one which surprised me the most it's actually really not iphone level but up there, really good video zoom just use pro mode if you want to pull out the most details keep it around 500 iso and everything auto, video in night auto mode is good but it does have some grains in it. battery life if good if you play bgmi, you will probably get 6 hours i play with smooth 90fps and 4x anti aliasing and don't use frame interpolation there is slight delay in gyro but does make it smoother but not recommended. battery is good few games and camera ussage will probably get you 6+ hours and light usage will get 8 hours +. charging takes 35 min to full charge. i haven't updated my phone since july, if you're in july patch then don't update that's the best update i've had and tested for performance and camera quality and would not recommend updating your phone as all other companies it might slow down if you want to update then look it up first then decide if you want update the software but wouldn't recommend only if the banking or other apps need the latest firmware the you need to update or you can go to the service centre and ask them to downgrade. ( i hope vivo and iqoo bring custom rom support because that would be great to have like poco and oneplus ).pros* good camera for the price could be bit better in video.* one of the best gaming phones does heat up but in a controlled way and cools down pretty fast.* really fast charging speed ( does heat a bit nothing to bother or just open settings - battery - charging and disable fast charging it will slightly slow down charging speed but it will decrease phone's surface temp ).* good display very bright overall really goodscreen.* very good after sale service ( disclaimer had experience with previous phone iqoo neo 6 regarding screen replacement bit pricey but really good experience and very fast.cons* mediocre selfie camera my old iqoo neo 6 had better selfie's than this paid 55k for a phone and no 4k selfie video front is the biggest downside of this phone.* ui is good very reliable but not as good as other android skins ( just updated to android 15 did make a way better and smoother but could be better).* and audio transmitter has kinda bad the output is not upto to the mark with bluetooh specifically had same problem with my neo 6 my poco f1 had really good audio dec on board than this two new phones.overall - 4.4/5this is rating is based on my experience, and also to point out i'm very heavy user, so the fact that it is able to keep up with demands is actually very commendable, and a brief disclaimer i am a long term iqoo user been using iqoo brand since 2022 but overall the phone is really good and has impressed me. that's the reason i'm taking my time and giving a review here.quick updateand btw regarding updating your phone i still stand by not updating your phone, but i have updated to android 15 i did reasearch thoroughly and decided update because there were a lot improvement and i don't plan on updating after this update ( so the phone is on android 15 nov security patch ).read more; the media could not be loaded.it's been 5m since i bought this phone had a great experience, switched from iqoo neo 6 and this upgrade is worth it if you want best performance and overall good camera, the photos are really good as it's vivo's sub brand so the image pipeline is really good just vibrant on some occasions but you will not be disappointed. and the video quality is the one which surprised me the most it's actually really not iphone level but up there, really good video zoom just use pro mode if you want to pull out the most details keep it around 500 iso and everything auto, video in night auto mode is good but it does have some grains in it. battery life if good if you play bgmi, you will probably get 6 hours i play with smooth 90fps and 4x anti aliasing and don't use frame interpolation there is slight delay in gyro but does make it smoother but not recommended. battery is good few games and camera ussage will probably get you 6+ hours and light usage will get 8 hours +. charging takes 35 min to full charge. i haven't updated my phone since july, if you're in july patch then don't update that's the best update i've had and tested for performance and camera quality and would not recommend updating your phone as all other companies it might slow down if you want to update then look it up first then decide if you want update the software but wouldn't recommend only if the banking or other apps need the latest firmware the you need to update or you can go to the service centre and ask them to downgrade.

i had recently ordered this phone and it's one of the best options under budget and for the people who do not use phone for prolonged durations. the functioning and screen is excellent . it has triple camera setup but the camera quality at this price is way above average seizing memories with exceptional sharpness and clarity. the battery life is decent but it gets a little heated when used for long duration but none the less it's not a bad option. the device features quick charging functionality. the display quality is good. during the initial time the processor was good but eventually it slowed down and phone gets hung often. the phone doesn't have an ip certification due to which contact with water might damage it. this purchase has truly exceeded my expectations and would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a premium smartphone experience at an affordable price.read more;

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

dear tech enthusiast,i recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and i felt compelled to share my impressions. in a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. however, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.the phone i'm referring to is the iqoo neo 10r. priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.here's a breakdown of my experience:performance: at the heart of this device lies the snapdragon 8s gen 3 chipset. this powerful processor, coupled with 8gb of ram, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like bgmi and cod mobile at high settings. i was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. the antutu gpu score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.display: the 6.78-inch amoled display with a 144hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. the colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. while the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.gaming features: iqoo has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the neo 10r. it boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in fps meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'monster mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. the inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.battery: the 6400mah battery is a significant highlight. it easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. even after intense gaming sessions, i was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.other notable aspects:* the phone supports 5g connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* it features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. the 50mp main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* the software experience is clean and optimized for performance.areas for potential improvement:* while the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* the camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.overall:the iqoo neo 10r offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. while there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. if gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iqoo neo 10r deserves a serious look.sincerely,a satisfied mobile gamer.read more;

the media could not be loaded.it's been 5m since i bought this phone had a great experience, switched from iqoo neo 6 and this upgrade is worth it if you want best performance and overall good camera, the photos are really good as it's vivo's sub brand so the image pipeline is really good just vibrant on some occasions but you will not be disappointed. and the video quality is the one which surprised me the most it's actually really not iphone level but up there, really good video zoom just use pro mode if you want to pull out the most details keep it around 500 iso and everything auto, video in night auto mode is good but it does have some grains in it. battery life if good if you play bgmi, you will probably get 6 hours i play with smooth 90fps and 4x anti aliasing and don't use frame interpolation there is slight delay in gyro but does make it smoother but not recommended. battery is good few games and camera ussage will probably get you 6+ hours and light usage will get 8 hours +. charging takes 35 min to full charge. i haven't updated my phone since july, if you're in july patch then don't update that's the best update i've had and tested for performance and camera quality and would not recommend updating your phone as all other companies it might slow down if you want to update then look it up first then decide if you want update the software but wouldn't recommend only if the banking or other apps need the latest firmware the you need to update or you can go to the service centre and ask them to downgrade.

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

booked my 12+512gb version as soon as it was launched. and after using it for more than a month, here's my review.pros1) exceptional camera quality. the 12mp ultra-wide does it's job and i would say going for 5x optical zoom with 50mp sensor instead for 10x 10mp sensor is a better choice as upto 30x i would say the pictures are more crisp than s23 ultra.2) build quality is premium. it feels like a high budget smartphone. not sure if titanium armor is enough to withstand high drop possibilities, but it does make it lighter.3) screen is a big improvement. the anti reflective corning gorilla glass armor does it's job and reflects most of the glare so you can sit easily and watch without worrying if the person sitting next to you is watching coz they can't. 😁3) s-pen has improved a bit. a lot of people are saying that they don't use it much after first time, but that's not the case with me. if you will get the hang of it, you will use it quite often.4) ai interface is quite excellent. although in initial phase, it does it's job in notes and summarising big pages so that you can easily get the gist.5) 7 years os and security update is a big big up from my side.6) the box like built rather than a curve display is a better choice. it's easier to find a screen protector.7) sanpdragan 8 gen3 is fast. you can play high end games at maximum capacity. android 14 with one ui 6 is smooth as you can hope it would be. i haven't recorded any lags or heating issues as for now.cons1) anti refective display works until you put  the above mention screen protector. after that it won't work with that precision. although it still does it's job.2) selfie camera is still not that great if you're using iphone 14 or 15 pro.3) generative ai is not that great in calls and photo editing. also, to pay for these services after 2025 is a big drawback from samsung.4) samsung is still not implementing faster charging protocols on their high and mid range smartphones. in a time when oneplus is offering 100w charging speeds and xiomi offering 50-80w wireless charging, samsung is still stuck with 45w and 15w wireless charging. big drawback. however, battery do last for a full day.5) speaking of charging, no charger included is a serious letdown when you're spending more than a lac on a high end smartphone. samsung, it doesn't feels good. 😔overall, a good smartphone if you're thinking to go for a big one for a long time.read more;

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

dear tech enthusiast,i recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and i felt compelled to share my impressions. in a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. however, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.the phone i'm referring to is the iqoo neo 10r. priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.here's a breakdown of my experience:performance: at the heart of this device lies the snapdragon 8s gen 3 chipset. this powerful processor, coupled with 8gb of ram, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like bgmi and cod mobile at high settings. i was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. the antutu gpu score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.display: the 6.78-inch amoled display with a 144hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. the colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. while the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.gaming features: iqoo has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the neo 10r. it boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in fps meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'monster mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. the inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.battery: the 6400mah battery is a significant highlight. it easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. even after intense gaming sessions, i was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.other notable aspects:* the phone supports 5g connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* it features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. the 50mp main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* the software experience is clean and optimized for performance.areas for potential improvement:* while the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* the camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.overall:the iqoo neo 10r offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. while there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. if gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iqoo neo 10r deserves a serious look.sincerely,a satisfied mobile gamer.read more;

this was my return to oneplus brand in 5 years after oneplus 7. previously i was using samsung galaxy s22+ for 2 years. my initial experience was great, but after a few months, i started to feel the phone's performance getting hit, which was a shock as samsung promised 5 years of os updates and it got a degraded performance just in a few month's time. also, the phone was heating up pretty badly even with a short span of gaming and drained the battery. then i decided to switch asap as the amazon gif was about to start and picked the glacial white colour and looks luxurious. also got the oneplus buds pro 2 worth 9k totally free.to begin with, i was a bit confused to purchase oneplus phone with all the green lines & motherboard fiasco. after a heavy research, i convinced myself to purchase the phone. till now the phone has been performing great and i am happy. my experience is drafted as pointers below:1. size of the phone - yes, it is a big & heavy phone an might need some tine to get used to it. i have big hands and i felt convenient holding it. the camera module is a bit bulky, but this issue got resolved after i slapped on a ringke case.2. performance - after purchasing, you have to give it a few days to adjust to your daily routines, charging habits etc. an you will notice some mild heating with some jitters in the ui. but after that the phone is now buttery smooth and i just love the way the animations work. only time you can feel some heat is during the camera use and charging. i play pes 2025 occasionally and it was smooth.3. cameras - yes, samsung did have a great set of cameras, but got degraded with updates. as of now oneplus 12 takes good photos. the macro& portrait shots are excellent. hope they keep improving on this. videos are also good enough. selfie camera here is still not upto the mark & samsung wins in the selfie section.4. battery & charging - this department really takes my breath away. my battery anxiety has gone down now. i easily get more than 7hrs of sot & 100w charger is extremely fast and saves my time. samsung literally lost in this department face down.5. screen - it's a 2k oled curved screen manufactured by boe that is bright enough with 1600 nits of hbm. i could easily read under direct sunlight and the ltpo display with the adaptive refresh rate works like a charm. this is my first curved screen experience and still getting used to it, but does look premium.6. build quality - the phone is sturdy with gorilla glass victus 2 in from & gorilla glass in the back. it holds firmly in your hands, but us a case as it is slippery.7. os - one ui is really good, loaded with features. oxygen os is now color os and has lost it's oxygen os feel. but the os is lighter than one ui which makes the sd8gen3 chipset snappier. it also has a few tricks up its sleeve and is very handy. (p.s. - happy to see the 3 fingers screenshot, as samsung did miss this.)some cons that i noticed:1. they could have give ip68 at this price.2. the cameral initially seems a bit off, but once you get used to its working mode, zoom style etc., then it will be fine.3. since i come from samsung, i feel that some features in samsung could have been implemented here also (like modes & routines, ai image editor).4. since the greenline issues & motherboard issue persists in almost all phone brands, better take in the extended warranty at rs 999.5. getting a screen protector is still a challenge. i have installed a skin to avoid scratches.the buds are also working fine and has a great audio signature.hopefully this phone lasts for me well. will keep you all posted in case of any updates. (i am using the ringke camo back cover which sits perfectly with the phone, just fyi)thank you!update on 14 oct 2024 - the phone is still performing well and the battery life is remarkable. for people looking for a good case, please select the ringke case for oneplus 12 as it has a better screen protection and holding grip. i took the camouflage version as it's back is not a fingerprint magnet.thank you.read more; this was my return to oneplus brand in 5 years after oneplus 7. previously i was using samsung galaxy s22+ for 2 years. my initial experience was great, but after a few months, i started to feel the phone's performance getting hit, which was a shock as samsung promised 5 years of os updates and it got a degraded performance just in a few month's time. also, the phone was heating up pretty badly even with a short span of gaming and drained the battery. then i decided to switch asap as the amazon gif was about to start and picked the glacial white colour and looks luxurious. also got the oneplus buds pro 2 worth 9k totally free.to begin with, i was a bit confused to purchase oneplus phone with all the green lines & motherboard fiasco. after a heavy research, i convinced myself to purchase the phone. till now the phone has been performing great and i am happy. my experience is drafted as pointers below:1. size of the phone - yes, it is a big & heavy phone an might need some tine to get used to it. i have big hands and i felt convenient holding it. the camera module is a bit bulky, but this issue got resolved after i slapped on a ringke case.2. performance - after purchasing, you have to give it a few days to adjust to your daily routines, charging habits etc. an you will notice some mild heating with some jitters in the ui. but after that the phone is now buttery smooth and i just love the way the animations work. only time you can feel some heat is during the camera use and charging. i play pes 2025 occasionally and it was smooth.3. cameras - yes, samsung did have a great set of cameras, but got degraded with updates. as of now oneplus 12 takes good photos. the macro& portrait shots are excellent. hope they keep improving on this. videos are also good enough. selfie camera here is still not upto the mark & samsung wins in the selfie section.4. battery & charging - this department really takes my breath away. my battery anxiety has gone down now. i easily get more than 7hrs of sot & 100w charger is extremely fast and saves my time. samsung literally lost in this department face down.5. screen - it's a 2k oled curved screen manufactured by boe that is bright enough with 1600 nits of hbm. i could easily read under direct sunlight and the ltpo display with the adaptive refresh rate works like a charm. this is my first curved screen experience and still getting used to it, but does look premium.6. build quality - the phone is sturdy with gorilla glass victus 2 in from & gorilla glass in the back. it holds firmly in your hands, but us a case as it is slippery.7. os - one ui is really good, loaded with features. oxygen os is now color os and has lost it's oxygen os feel. but the os is lighter than one ui which makes the sd8gen3 chipset snappier. it also has a few tricks up its sleeve and is very handy.

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

dear tech enthusiast,i recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and i felt compelled to share my impressions. in a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. however, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.the phone i'm referring to is the iqoo neo 10r. priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.here's a breakdown of my experience:performance: at the heart of this device lies the snapdragon 8s gen 3 chipset. this powerful processor, coupled with 8gb of ram, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like bgmi and cod mobile at high settings. i was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. the antutu gpu score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.display: the 6.78-inch amoled display with a 144hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. the colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. while the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.gaming features: iqoo has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the neo 10r. it boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in fps meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'monster mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. the inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.battery: the 6400mah battery is a significant highlight. it easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. even after intense gaming sessions, i was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.other notable aspects:* the phone supports 5g connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* it features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. the 50mp main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* the software experience is clean and optimized for performance.areas for potential improvement:* while the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* the camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.overall:the iqoo neo 10r offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. while there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. if gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iqoo neo 10r deserves a serious look.sincerely,a satisfied mobile gamer.read more;

first and foremost i would like to say that there is nothing great about this smartphone. what i mean is this is a jack of all trades kind of thing.1. design and display - look wise this thing is a beauty. weight is slightly higher than what i would like but not a deal breaker. that nipple notch people complain about is not even an issue as your brain automatically gets used to it fairly quickly.coming to display this is my first samsung phone and as everyone says samsung panels are the best and they are not wrong. sharpness is great,colors produced are excellent and black and whites are rich and detailed all the way. brightness is more than good enough for both outdoor use and use in dark room at night as it does get very dim so your eyes don't strain as much.2. camera - both rear and front produce really good photo and video quality given the lighting conditions are good. low light quality is decent enough. photos come out a little saturated but nothing over the top. although sometimes i feel there is a slight shutter lag when there are lots of details in the frame. front camera produces ample details and good skin tones.3. performance- there is no lag in the ui or any heavy apps . everything runs buttery smooth provided 120hz refresh rate setting is always on. i did some casual gaming and there were no frame drops or jitters whatsoever.  also i would like to add if you want to go for heavy gaming you would want to go to game launcher settings and turn high performance mode and also a setting that turns on high frame rate with touch controls. all in all this is more than good enough for 90% of things you throw at it.4. battery - after reading many mixed reviews i was quite skeptical about battery life but man was i proven wrong. after finishing setup and installing 30plus apps i full charged my phone and did a complete one day (24hrs)heavy usage to check battery life . i easily got 8plus sot on mixed 5g and wifi ,screen brightness ranging from 30-80%. usage ranged from social media, youtube, camera , some games, phone customization and both network and whatsapp calls. battery idle drain is also very minimal.5. speakers - this is where things get weird. don't get me wrong the sound is rich loud and dare i say brilliant.  but there is one issue.  whenever you turn dolby atmos on and keep volume around 40% the back panel near the bottom will vibrate and its the annoying kind of vibrations. i tried with a case but there was not much difference. you need to learn to hold slightly differently or ignore it.6. price - after coupons and bank offers i got a pretty good deal and feel like this is a value for money phone. (avoid it if you get it around 28k or more.)7. charging- there is no charger provided so add another 1k to your total budget.  charging while on the slow side comparatively a 25 w samsung charger takes around 25 minutes to go from 20-85% which is the range we should be charging our phones anyway to make the batteries working life as long as possible so charging time is not an issue for me personally .8. network - network seems to be good enough on both 5g ,lte and wifi. no call drops or voice breaks whatsoever. internet speeds are very good as well.9. fingerprint sensor - this is another area which has annoyed me . setting up fingerprints is easy but very rarely it just behaves like a stubborn child and doesn't want to work at all. i needed to restart the device  two times which fixed the issue. otherwise most of the times it's reliable( works 9/10 attempts) and decently fast ( takes .75 seconds approximately).this is it guys . all in all a good device with very few compromises. heavy gamers should look elsewhere though.  i would update review after a major update is available. thank you.read more; first and foremost i would like to say that there is nothing great about this smartphone. what i mean is this is a jack of all trades kind of thing.1. design and display - look wise this thing is a beauty. weight is slightly higher than what i would like but not a deal breaker. that nipple notch people complain about is not even an issue as your brain automatically gets used to it fairly quickly.coming to display this is my first samsung phone and as everyone says samsung panels are the best and they are not wrong. sharpness is great,colors produced are excellent and black and whites are rich and detailed all the way. brightness is more than good enough for both outdoor use and use in dark room at night as it does get very dim so your eyes don't strain as much.2. camera - both rear and front produce really good photo and video quality given the lighting conditions are good. low light quality is decent enough. photos come out a little saturated but nothing over the top. although sometimes i feel there is a slight shutter lag when there are lots of details in the frame. front camera produces ample details and good skin tones.3. performance- there is no lag in the ui or any heavy apps . everything runs buttery smooth provided 120hz refresh rate setting is always on. i did some casual gaming and there were no frame drops or jitters whatsoever.  also i would like to add if you want to go for heavy gaming you would want to go to game launcher settings and turn high performance mode and also a setting that turns on high frame rate with touch controls. all in all this is more than good enough for 90% of things you throw at it.4. battery - after reading many mixed reviews i was quite skeptical about battery life but man was i proven wrong. after finishing setup and installing 30plus apps i full charged my phone and did a complete one day (24hrs)heavy usage to check battery life . i easily got 8plus sot on mixed 5g and wifi ,screen brightness ranging from 30-80%. usage ranged from social media, youtube, camera , some games, phone customization and both network and whatsapp calls. battery idle drain is also very minimal.5. speakers - this is where things get weird. don't get me wrong the sound is rich loud and dare i say brilliant.  but there is one issue.  whenever you turn dolby atmos on and keep volume around 40% the back panel near the bottom will vibrate and its the annoying kind of vibrations. i tried with a case but there was not much difference. you need to learn to hold slightly differently or ignore it.6. price - after coupons and bank offers i got a pretty good deal and feel like this is a value for money phone.

dear tech enthusiast,i recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and i felt compelled to share my impressions. in a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. however, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.the phone i'm referring to is the iqoo neo 10r. priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.here's a breakdown of my experience:performance: at the heart of this device lies the snapdragon 8s gen 3 chipset. this powerful processor, coupled with 8gb of ram, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like bgmi and cod mobile at high settings. i was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. the antutu gpu score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.display: the 6.78-inch amoled display with a 144hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. the colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. while the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.gaming features: iqoo has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the neo 10r. it boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in fps meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'monster mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. the inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.battery: the 6400mah battery is a significant highlight. it easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. even after intense gaming sessions, i was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.other notable aspects:* the phone supports 5g connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* it features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. the 50mp main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* the software experience is clean and optimized for performance.areas for potential improvement:* while the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* the camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.overall:the iqoo neo 10r offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. while there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. if gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iqoo neo 10r deserves a serious look.sincerely,a satisfied mobile gamer.read more;

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

bought this phone with a bit of trepidation because 3 of the 7 samsung phones i have bought prior to this one  - either for myself or family - have developed a screen issue, although only one was serious enough to require a visit to the service center. thought of switching to a different company but seeing as all of them usually end up with some issue or the other, and the ratings of most of them end up around 4 stars anyway, i decided to stick with the known devil. and besides the display issue, most have served for a good time, including its ancestor, the m30, that this will replace. that too developed a screen issue but it was after 4 years of use so not complaining too much.initial impressions so far has been decent. they have finally got rid of the water drop notch and gone with the punch hole in the m3x series, so that is good, it looks nicer. even the overall design has been upgraded to bring it closer to the flagship s series with the flat sides and no camera island. no sharp edges either, so it is not uncomfortable to hold... except for the weight.samsung phones, particularly the non flagship ones, are heavier than they should be for some reason (comparing to similarly spec'd phones by other companies), and this one is on the heavier side even among those at 222g. my primary phone too is heavy (not samsung) so i am used to it, but i would nonetheless like a lighter phone. my father's m52 which has a 5000mah battery is 50g lighter and so much more comfortable in the hand and the pocket.if you add a case and a screen protector, the weight will increase even further so note that. the 6000mah battery however does its job and the phone is lasting me 1.5 - 2 days between charge. i'm not a heavy user though, no gaming or constant camera usage and such so your mileage may vary.i like the fingerprint sensor in the power button, very responsive. better than the in display type i think. it supports sd card (hybrid sim - sd card) so that's good. the base 128gb model should be enough because of this, can upgrade storage with an sd card when needed.they have dropped the audio jack, but i have moved on to wireless so not a concern for me but i know there are die hard fans. a related drawback though is that fm radios are no longer possible since they need a wired earphone to act as antenna. i didnt use it too frequently but it was nice to have for those rare occasions.not much of a camera guy so cant comment on how good or bad it is. didn't notice any slowness or other issues, works well enough for my basic needs. no heating either - it was slightly warm during charging which is normal and again a little bit during video recording and the like, but that was barely so, less than during charging. i dont really do too many heavy processing type tasks, or even gaming.for regular needs this phone should be fine i think. if it stays this way for a few years i think i will be happy with this phone. on paper it seems to be a good phone at a decent price. i took a gamble by buying it soon after launch, without waiting for reviews. i havent noticed any drawbacks so far and hopefully it wont give me any reason to regret later on. fingers crossed. giving it 5 stars for now, will update if anything happens.read more;

dear tech enthusiast,i recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and i felt compelled to share my impressions. in a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. however, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.the phone i'm referring to is the iqoo neo 10r. priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.here's a breakdown of my experience:performance: at the heart of this device lies the snapdragon 8s gen 3 chipset. this powerful processor, coupled with 8gb of ram, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like bgmi and cod mobile at high settings. i was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. the antutu gpu score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.display: the 6.78-inch amoled display with a 144hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. the colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. while the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.gaming features: iqoo has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the neo 10r. it boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in fps meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'monster mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. the inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.battery: the 6400mah battery is a significant highlight. it easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. even after intense gaming sessions, i was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.other notable aspects:* the phone supports 5g connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* it features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. the 50mp main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* the software experience is clean and optimized for performance.areas for potential improvement:* while the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* the camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.overall:the iqoo neo 10r offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. while there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. if gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iqoo neo 10r deserves a serious look.sincerely,a satisfied mobile gamer.read more;

i am using samsung after a long time. especially, i have never used samsung android before. and now i don’t want to use other android phones at all. one ui is really a charm. lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean ui, that’s what i can tell about samsung’s one ui, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. now i understand why people who used samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. at least, i don’t want to switch very soon.now coming to the phone. i have got this for rs. 34000/- during the big billion day sale.battery: my main concern was the battery, and this is the reason i didn’t go for s23 fe, which was available at almost the same price. the battery in the a55 is better than the one in s23 fe. in fact, i would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. it gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. i charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. the battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.build quality: the reason i didn’t go for the a35. both are designed the same, but the a55 has an aluminium frame. it makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. i admit that the aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. and i intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.display: i think i don’t need to say much about samsung’s display. it has a 120hz samoled screen, which is very beautiful. you can limit the refresh rate to 60hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.update policy: samsung promises to provide 4 years of android updates and 5 years of security updates. i think samsung will keep their promise, and i will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.camera: camera isn’t one of the usps of this phone, mostly for the redundant macro sensor. the macro sensor isn’t very good. they could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the s23 fe. the 50mp main camera and the 12mp ultrawide lens is good. low light photography is also very good with this camera. i guess its not possible to upgrade a macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.adaptability: last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. you will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.the samsung galaxy a55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.read more;

first impressions:1. while it has a lcd display. it appears to be decent with not too prominent of a light bleeding.2. although it's 120hz rr, the display usually operates at 90hz for most system apps when set to smart, which is rather weird but not a deal breaker, and you can always change it to 120hz in settings.3. there are bloatware but you can uninstall most of them.4. battery backup is definitely its usp. having a 6000mah battery can do wonders especially in the long run.5. 44w adapter included. takes around 1.5 hours to fully charge.6. camera is nothing to brag about. it's a decent single shooter. no ultrawide or even a macro cam per say.7. lastly, performance is definitely on the upper spectrum in the price range. all other phones are offering mtk6100 while it has sd6gen1 which definitely performs better. and there are some phones which do not even offer 8gb variant.8. very good stereo speakers for the price range plus would you look at that, a headphone jack.overall, a very solid phone in the price range.update: one star deducted - the camera quality is abysmal. there is no optimization done on the camera. colors are absolutely washed out, image quality is soft and noisy even at daylight.update after 2+ weeks of usage:1. with light to medium, my mom is able to squeeze 3 days with a single charge which is highly impressive.2. phone runs smoothly are rather cool even when it charges.3. a capable set of speakers. while they do not sound full and airy, they do get the job done with less distortion.read more;

dear tech enthusiast,i recently had the pleasure of experiencing a gaming phone that falls comfortably under the ₹30,000 price bracket, and i felt compelled to share my impressions. in a market flooded with options, finding a device that balances performance and affordability can be a daunting task. however, this particular contender has genuinely impressed me with its capabilities.the phone i'm referring to is the iqoo neo 10r. priced competitively at around ₹26,999 for the base variant, it stands out as a strong contender for gamers on a budget.here's a breakdown of my experience:performance: at the heart of this device lies the snapdragon 8s gen 3 chipset. this powerful processor, coupled with 8gb of ram, ensures smooth and lag-free gaming even on demanding titles like bgmi and cod mobile at high settings. i was particularly impressed by the consistent frame rates and the minimal heating during extended gaming sessions. the antutu gpu score of 4,99,035 speaks volumes about its graphical prowess.display: the 6.78-inch amoled display with a 144hz refresh rate offers a vibrant and fluid visual experience. the colors are rich, and the fast refresh rate makes gameplay feel incredibly responsive. while the resolution is adequate, a slightly higher resolution could have elevated the visual fidelity further, but at this price point, it's a minor compromise.gaming features: iqoo has clearly focused on the gaming experience with the neo 10r. it boasts dedicated gaming features like a built-in fps meter, an e-sports mode, and a 'monster mode' that optimizes the phone for peak gaming performance. the inclusion of bypass charging is a thoughtful addition, allowing you to game for extended periods without significantly heating the battery.battery: the 6400mah battery is a significant highlight. it easily lasted me through a full day of moderate use, including several hours of gaming. even after intense gaming sessions, i was left with enough power to get through the rest of the day.other notable aspects:* the phone supports 5g connectivity, ensuring future-proof network capabilities.* it features a decent camera setup, although it's not the primary focus of this device. the 50mp main camera captures good quality images in daylight.* the software experience is clean and optimized for performance.areas for potential improvement:* while the polycarbonate build feels sturdy, it might not feel as premium as some of the glass-backed competitors.* the camera performance, while adequate, could be better, especially in low-light conditions.overall:the iqoo neo 10r offers an exceptional gaming experience without breaking the bank. its powerful processor, high refresh rate display, dedicated gaming features, and long-lasting battery make it a compelling choice for budget-conscious gamers. while there are a few minor compromises, the overall package delivers excellent value for its price. if gaming is your priority and you're looking for a phone under ₹30,000, the iqoo neo 10r deserves a serious look.sincerely,a satisfied mobile gamer.read more;

i am using samsung after a long time. especially, i have never used samsung android before. and now i don’t want to use other android phones at all. one ui is really a charm. lots of customisations, user-friendliness and a clean ui, that’s what i can tell about samsung’s one ui, and once you start using this with its useful features, you get used to this, and you don’t want to switch. now i understand why people who used samsung android once in their life don’t want to go to another brand. at least, i don’t want to switch very soon.now coming to the phone. i have got this for rs. 34000/- during the big billion day sale.battery: my main concern was the battery, and this is the reason i didn’t go for s23 fe, which was available at almost the same price. the battery in the a55 is better than the one in s23 fe. in fact, i would say that this is one of the longest running batteries in the market. it gives you almost 6.5 hours of screen on time, if you charge it to 100%. i charge it to 80%, which is good for the battery, and you can set this in settings. the battery will stop charging once it reaches 80%. set that and your battery will be healthy for more years.build quality: the reason i didn’t go for the a35. both are designed the same, but the a55 has an aluminium frame. it makes it a bit heavier, but is definitely worth it. i admit that the aluminium frame isn’t visible if you use a case, which you should do, but it adds to the phone’s durability. and i intend to use this for at least 4-5 years, so durability is a big thing for this phone.display: i think i don’t need to say much about samsung’s display. it has a 120hz samoled screen, which is very beautiful. you can limit the refresh rate to 60hz, it consumes less battery, but looks equally awesome.update policy: samsung promises to provide 4 years of android updates and 5 years of security updates. i think samsung will keep their promise, and i will be able to use this phone for up to 6 years without any concern.camera: camera isn’t one of the usps of this phone, mostly for the redundant macro sensor. the macro sensor isn’t very good. they could easily replace it with a telephoto lens, but then no one would buy the s23 fe. the 50mp main camera and the 12mp ultrawide lens is good. low light photography is also very good with this camera. i guess its not possible to upgrade a macro lens through updates, so you have to sacrifice the telephoto lens for good battery life.adaptability: last, but not the least, this phone adapts to your usage. you will feel this after a few days of usage, and it feels very good.the samsung galaxy a55 is a good budget phone, if you prefer battery life and durability over telephoto zoom lens.read more;
