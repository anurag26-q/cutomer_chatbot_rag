update 31march2025: (this post will help people as i see many reporting issues with connectivity/distortion/quality. )the issue as i see is with samsung android devices and not with other phones like nothing 2a as a family member has that and this headphone works fine there. nevertheless, if you experience distortion or quality issues, you can try changing the bluetooth codec as mentioned below.samsung has its own codec too which it uses for its earbuds.update 30march2025: (this post will help people as i see many reporting issues with connectivity/distortion/quality. )mostly as i saw the reviews - issues reported were with distorted sound/quality of sound and with a set of devices and mostly people saying that it was seen with windows pc. i was able to fix the problem myself. please note: there was no help from noise. noise tech did not help troubleshoot.).my ticket was just closed from noise end and so i realised if i went back there again,  the device would just  go back and forth only but my problem would not get fixed. no one from noise called me through the entire process to even understand the issue in detail or even when it was marked checked after sending it back for the first time.----technical explanation---how i solved the issue - a common problem reported from multiple reviews was about distortion(sometimes written as quality) and was with some devices and then mostly with windows pc users. so, it cannot be that such a priced headphone will have substandard quality when some verified purchases reviews having 5 stars. the battery is good. so, some issue might be with the chipset hardware.""codec"" is coding-decoding and a bluetooth codec is used to compress and decompress audio data for efficient wireless transmission. depending upon the codec the quality of your sound differs.this device seems to be defaulting to aac (advcd audio encoding) which apple devices use. i had to go to ""developer options"" in android (to enable ""developer options"" in android please google it) and try another codec. i switched to sbc (sub-band codec) on my phone which is a very old codec and is prone to losses, and then it sounded fine. attached two images for reference.for samsung:1 go to ""settings""2 tap ""about device"" or ""about phone""3 tap “software information”4 tap “build number” seven times. ...5 enter your pattern, pin or password to enable the developer options menu.6 the ""developer options"" menu will now appear in your settings menu.please note: your phone needs to be connected/paired with the headset for you to be able to see the bluetooth codec option in your ""developer options"" in android. if you are not connected to the headset, the option for codec selection will be grayed out.but upon shutting down and turning back on after few hours, when it pairs again, the setting goes back to aac at times. its a pain changing it again when you disconnect and reconnect back.on pc its completely distorted. windows does not allow to change codecs. based on what i found, it does not have selections like we have for android. i will keep looking for a way to change it.whichever manufacturer the chipset is being imported from, is having different codecs than samsung android.update 29march2025:i received the headphones back from noise and they just sent back the same thing in broken state.i cannot imagine why a company is doing this. it's like ""here its back again but just in a diff box""now again open a ticket and then send back item. why did i purchase this from amazon in the first place. i should have gone to a shop purchased it. atleast would not be facing this.complete utter disregard to customer. its customer problem. let him be with a broken thing.========================never seen such worse quality by paying this much money. sound distorted right out from the box. listen to audio -spotify or anything, even phone call, sound is heavily distorted. any other of my old bluetooth headphones and earphones are fine. breaks heavily in between. i do not know how even people gave it 5 stars. but if you hear a music, its as if like the audio tape is getting stuck in between.not worth the money. defective in sound right from the box. never seen such bad quality that too for a higher priced item.and to top it, amazon's stand is this has to be taken up with noise only. that too i just received it today.i opened up a ticket with noise. will have to wait for their response.have never seen such a worse pricey product.read more;

i'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment i experienced with the noise two wirless. these headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.let's start with the build quality. imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. they weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.now, i'm a reasonable person. accidents happen. so, i contacted noise support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. what i got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. they dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).so, here i am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. the audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. my advice? steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.for those seeking a more constructive alternative:do your research! read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.prioritize build quality. look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.understand the warranty terms thoroughly. don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.read more;

hello guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition. most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. but the durability of this product is very bad. it is almost fully made of plastic. so if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. the major problem i faced using these headphones is the quality of the aux cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). it is average in terms of gaming. if you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. you can buy this headphone for games like minecraft. for music, this headphone is fantastic. no choice other than this at this price range.thank you for reading. just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.read more;

hello guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition. most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. but the durability of this product is very bad. it is almost fully made of plastic. so if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. the major problem i faced using these headphones is the quality of the aux cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). it is average in terms of gaming. if you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. you can buy this headphone for games like minecraft. for music, this headphone is fantastic. no choice other than this at this price range.thank you for reading. just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.read more;

media could not be loaded.before receiving the product, these were my concerns:-1. alot of reviews were bout how the mic is bad , hence i was concerned.2. worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. cuz i needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.3.comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .4.sturdiness and build quality.5.looks obviously , pictures were good but i didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. not a single concern was founded to be true.1.mic is working absolutely fine. you can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. if you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). for all other purposes its perfect.2.i received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am i switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. it has been playing non stop. its perfect. if you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. you don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). battery life is sufficient. i haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. anyway , by what i've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. very comfortable. its definitely over the ears and completely covers them. even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. also , i dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , i've seen heavier gaming headphones. don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .4.build quality is very nice , sturdy and strong. the speakers are tightly held with the band and while i don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. it loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . the rgb looks so beautiful and catchy. the overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. everything is perfect. though i wish now that i should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... it would've looked cooler with rgb.6. with bluetooth , its justt awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ i like it (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). i don't play games so i can't talk bout latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. now talking bout the wired mode. it might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. the clarity is just perfect and no latency ofcourse. no need of battery in aux mode. can keep using it even if the battery is dead. i like this feature so much. for a student like me , its a charmer. no unnecessary breaks . and with the full sound ☠️ you won't hear even if someone's getting murderrred in the next room ☠️ its that awesome.  sound does leak , but its tooo loud as well. i mean , its like a freakin mini speaker on medium volume when you keep it aside and max the volume. it is crazyyyy . you can just hang it on your neck if it gets too hot n you'll still hear everything.it is honestly my very first wireless headphones. but i have used boat rockerz which my friend has , and i can say without a doubt , giving 200 more for this one is definitely worth it.the comfort , the looks , the loudness , the rgb (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). i even got 129 cashback so it had to be a steal deal for me 😁.i'm so glad i bought this as my first headphones. i was very skeptical but now that i'm using it 😍 , its just a wonderful experience.most negative comments i believe are one in hundred instances or anomaly or exceptions. most people don't review a product till it's defective. only very few people review when the product it perfect.this is to help first timers like me or for anyone who want a good headphone.don't worry bout anything , just go for it. luck can be bad sometimes nd you might get a bad piece , just get it replaced nd voila , problems solved. its not like 100% of manufactured products are bad ☠️. anyway. ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.read more; the media could not be loaded.before receiving the product, these were my concerns:-1. alot of reviews were bout how the mic is bad , hence i was concerned.2. worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. cuz i needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.3.comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .4.sturdiness and build quality.5.looks obviously , pictures were good but i didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. not a single concern was founded to be true.1.mic is working absolutely fine. you can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. if you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). for all other purposes its perfect.2.i received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am i switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. it has been playing non stop. its perfect. if you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. you don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). battery life is sufficient. i haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. anyway , by what i've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. very comfortable. its definitely over the ears and completely covers them. even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. also , i dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , i've seen heavier gaming headphones. don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .4.build quality is very nice , sturdy and strong. the speakers are tightly held with the band and while i don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. it loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . the rgb looks so beautiful and catchy. the overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. everything is perfect. though i wish now that i should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... it would've looked cooler with rgb.6. with bluetooth , its justt awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ i like it (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). i don't play games so i can't talk bout latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. now talking bout the wired mode. it might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. the clarity is just perfect and no latency ofcourse. no need of battery in aux mode. can keep using it even if the battery is dead. i like this feature so much. for a student like me , its a charmer. no unnecessary breaks . and with the full sound ☠️ you won't hear even if someone's getting murderrred in the next room ☠️ its that awesome.  sound does leak , but its tooo loud as well. i mean , its like a freakin mini speaker on

put straight for 2 to 3 hours, after it might feel a bit discomfort, depends on person to person. great battery, brand claims 40hr and i get too around 38 to 39hr in it which says its approved for long hours. very good sound quality, if you are confused between two headphones in this budget and you like bass more, then pick this one it has great bass. so everything is good, but there is one major, very big problem which is kinda aceeptable for someone and not for a lot of pepole. the problem is sound leakage, if you listen even above 50% vol or for some songs even at 30% vol, the sound starts to get outside earphone. your experience won't get bad for urself but the outsiders could also hear it which is why its not good to use it in public. if u go on 90% volume, rather than a headphone it becomes a speaker, u won't face any problem in ears, but voice outside will come loud easily hearable. it means brand gave everything, but could not block the speakers towards the outer end meaning voice gets outside easilyread more; great budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together. great build

earphones are more comfortable for long use where as over the ear kind compresses the skull.; 3.5/5i have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. i got it for a nice deal (approx. rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). i was reviewing multiple headphones under the rs. 5k range. my first choice was the sony ch-520, but i did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and i didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under rs. 5k). the other options were boat, zebronics (a different set), hammer and a variety of other ones.among them i did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. i wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. it was available at a reasonable price and the rgb lights impressed me. so i ordered them.pros:- sounds good! i'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. no issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. the bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- sturdy. the headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. while laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. i have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. they are still in good shape- rgb. the lights are definitely funky. they look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- battery. applaudable battery without hesitation. i use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.cons:- mic. i've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. my peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what i just said- huge cushions and ear muffs! the size of the muffs are simply too big. when traveling with the headphones on in buses, i like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. but this is simply not possibly with these headphones. the muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. when i try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. so i'm forced to sit rigid for a while- terrible button placement. the power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. this makes it very hard to use the controls. i have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. it's so ridiculous that i stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- bad usb-c connection slot. the usb-c connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other usb-c wires because it has a narrow deep opening. so my phone's usb-c charger doesn't fit in it. only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. this means i always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackoverall decent pair. in my previous (edited now) review, i mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. after several days i realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. so, i have edited my review and updated the ratingcheers!read more; 3.5/5i have been using these headphones for over 2 months

i've been using the hammer blash max headphones for a month, and they’re honestly a hidden gem. the sound quality is absolutely incredible – rich, deep, and crystal clear. the mic performs great, making calls smooth, and the sound isolation helps me stay focused on my studies. as a student, it's a perfect choice, especially when compared to brands like noise or boat in the same price range. the premium feel of these headphones really stands out.what really sets the blash max apart is the design. the 180-degree rotation ensures they stay safe from damage when not in use, unlike other headsets that can break or tilt. the soft cushions and matte finish make long online classes and study sessions comfortable. plus, they're ideal for outdoor activities, traveling, and gym workouts – they won’t fall off like buds, which is a huge bonus. covering the full ear, they provide a much better experience than typical on-ear headphones.the build quality is fantastic, and the customer support team is quick and responsive if you ever need assistance. the only slight drawback is the charging time, but once charged, the call quality is premium and clear, and the music is immersive. what really impressed me is the touch controls – something you rarely find in other brands at this price. if you're looking for a durable, stylish, and functional headset, the hammer blash max is the way to go!read more;

were good but i didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. not a single concern was founded to be true.1.mic is working absolutely fine. you can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. if you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). for all other purposes its perfect.2.i received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am i switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. it has been playing non stop. its perfect. if you switch off the lights

a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. the clarity is just perfect and no latency ofcourse. no need of battery in aux mode. can keep using it even if the battery is

long hours. very good sound quality, if you are confused between two headphones in this budget and you like bass more, then pick this one it has great bass. so everything is good, but there is one major, very big problem which is kinda aceeptable for someone and not for a lot of pepole. the problem is sound leakage, if you listen even above 50% vol or for some songs even at 30% vol, the sound starts to get outside earphone. your experience won't get bad for urself but the outsiders could also hear it which is why its not good to use it in public. if u go on 90% volume, rather than a headphone it becomes a speaker, u won't face any problem in ears, but voice outside will come loud easily hearable. it means brand gave everything, but could not block the speakers towards the outer

earphones are more comfortable for long use where as over the ear kind compresses the skull.; 3.5/5i have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. i got it for a nice deal (approx. rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). i was reviewing multiple headphones under the rs. 5k range. my first choice was the sony ch-520, but i did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and i didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under rs. 5k). the other options were boat, zebronics (a different set), hammer and a variety of other ones.among them i did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. i wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. it was available at a reasonable price and the rgb lights impressed me. so i ordered them.pros:- sounds good! i'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. no issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. the bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- sturdy. the headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. while laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. i have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. they are still in good shape- rgb. the lights are definitely funky. they look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- battery. applaudable battery without hesitation. i use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.cons:- mic. i've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. my peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what i just said- huge cushions and ear muffs! the size of the muffs are simply too big. when traveling with the headphones on in buses, i like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. but this is simply not possibly with these headphones. the muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. when i try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. so i'm forced to sit rigid for a while- terrible button placement. the power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. this makes it very hard to use the controls. i have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. it's so ridiculous that i stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- bad usb-c connection slot. the usb-c connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other usb-c wires because it has a narrow deep opening. so my phone's usb-c charger doesn't fit in it. only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. this means i always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackoverall decent pair. in my previous (edited now) review, i mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. after several days i

i'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment i experienced with the noise two wirless. these headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.let's start with the build quality. imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. they weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.now, i'm a reasonable person. accidents happen. so, i contacted noise support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. what i got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. they dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).so, here i am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. the audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. my advice? steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.for those seeking a more constructive alternative:do your research! read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.prioritize build quality. look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.understand the warranty terms thoroughly. don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.read more;

i have been using various anc headphones for years and i bought these because my airpods pro got spoilt and i forgot my bose quiet control 30s at home while travelling. it looks pretty good with impressive fit and finish. the buttons feel well built yet the headphone is quite light. it did not hurt my ears even after long hours of continuous use.sound quality: i am an audio visual production professional and i felt it sounds quite balanced (for a jbl) in the eq off setting. pump up the volume and it can get pretty loud. the 'super bass' eq mode really pumps up the bass. the bass response is deep with precise attacks and releases, does not sound boomy at all. i like how these headphones sound. the calling quality too is surprisingly good. it cuts most ambient noises coming into the microphone while on a phone call.anc: does the job okay but there are much better anc headphones available in the market. compared to the bose quiet series, the apple airpods pro or even the sony headphones with anc these felt inferior. in my recent travel in an airplane, these headphones started crackling; especially while the airplane was taking off. the filtration of the aircraft engine sound kept varying throughout my three hours of flying.ergonomics: it takes a little while to get used to the position of the buttons. i felt that the anc on-off toggle button should have been placed on the other earpiece of the headphone and not along with the power button or the volume control/play-pause buttons. again, takes a while to get used to this button position. the charging port is on the top side of the right earpiece. thus, you cannot use the headphones while charging them. the wired connection option is definitely a handy option if you want to use them connected to a computer on a table. the wire is a trrs jack and kept playing in mono when connected to a trs only socket.battery backup: very good battery backup so even with a continuous use with anc for approx 6 hours and with about 60% volume on music and multiple phone calls, it just consumed 40% charge.overall verdict: it's a good buy only if you have budget constraints and you're offered hefty discounts. if not then there are far better anc headphones available in the market.read more;

this headphone is a bag of mixed feelings, but let me break down what is good about it and what is missing.on one hand i feel there is a lack of bass when i am listening to pop and upbeat music, but at the same time i works well when i am watching documentaries or doing editing as it enhances the audio by boosting its treble. so if you are a music lover and loves a lot of bass, it is not for you. you can amp up your bass from the device you have paired it to, but it doesn't hit anywhere close to premium bass quality. on the other hand if you watch a lot of content which involves dialogues and documentaries, this is the perfect headphone for you as it gives amazing speech clarity. i would say this is also an editors and gamers headphone, where communication is very important and speeches takes great importance over beats and rhythms. i like that we can swap between ambient aware and noise cancellation, and it's greatest pro is the battery life. this headphone as a very good battery life, you can run it for days without even realizing that you need to charge it. i use it for work, meetings and calls, and also for editing purpose, and i am happy with my purchase, but if i was a sound editor or into audio compositing i think there are better options in the market at the same price.read more;

the boat rockerz line is boat's super cheap lineup for budget buyers. this will likely be many people's first foray into the world of wireless headphones, and is likely to turn many people off by its many compromises. it might be worth buying your grandma as a gift, but is  not something i'd ever recommend buying for your own use.1. sound quality - awful. honestly, the boat rockerz 450 does little more than bring your phone's audio loser to your ears. it isn't any significant improvement over your phone's speaker, and might actually be an active downgrade from your computer's speakers. most audio sounds tinny, there's little to no bass, and absolutely zero noise cancellation. on or off, you can and will hear the outside world. those who carry wireless headphones to tune out the outside world on walks or airplanes will be sorely disappointed. the soundstage is very small and shallow, and even non-audiophiles will notice the poor sound quality.2. comfort - horrendous. the boat rockerz 450 is a pain to wear, both literally and figuratively. the audio sounds horrible, and your ears will feel horrible too after an hour of use, maybe less. the good battery life means nothing if you cant use these headphones for more than 45 minutes at a time. after removing these headphones, your ears will hurt for a long while, and you'll feel like never wearing these again. the cans are very small, even for on-ear headphones, and people with spectacles or large heads will be even worse off. the frame doesn't extend very far, and also slips down quite easily.3. build quality - in a word - bad. see a pattern here? the headphones reflect their low price point, and are  entirely made of cheap plastic. the plastic also doesn't flex much, and the headphones seem very easy to break by accident. it's worth noting that the cups don't extend much. if you're one of those guys who like to leave their headphones dangling around their neck when not in use, you'll find yourself unable to lower your head without your headphones biting into your jaw. finally, the cups absorb a lot of sweat. you'l find yourself wanting to wash the cups and frustrated that you can't. it's really gross.5. mic - absolutely trash tier. you won't even be able to use the mic for how bad it is. i honestly forgot these headphones even had a mic because it's so soft and picks up so much background noise. callers will not be able to hear you clearly and will keep urging you to switch back to your phone, and you can forget about trying to use these with your pc for voice chat or conference calls. don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a mic with this headset - the mic only exists on paper. it's really not worth using.4. final words - just, don't. spend a bit more, get a decent pair of wireless headphones. the headset doesn't even connect properly half the time, and when it does, you'll wish it didn't. save  up some money, work at mcdonalds, and treat yourself to some good headphones. anything, but not these ones. the only good thing about these cans is the battery life, but what use it battery life if you don't want to use these headphones?1 buildread more;

hello guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition. most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. but the durability of this product is very bad. it is almost fully made of plastic. so if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. the major problem i faced using these headphones is the quality of the aux cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). it is average in terms of gaming. if you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. you can buy this headphone for games like minecraft. for music, this headphone is fantastic. no choice other than this at this price range.thank you for reading. just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.read more;

surprisingly exceeded my expectations. although i am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. there is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. which is a pity, but ah well. can't have it all, can ya?best bluetooth headphones at 799 for sound and mic quality. and let's not forget comfort. headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.even though i have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. so if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these. but if you don't mind going for earphones, then there are many better options available in terms of sound quality.read more;

if you're considering to buy this pair of headphones or have already brought it and need a little tweak to the sound to up the excitement, give this review a read. i know it's somewhat lengthy :( but if you've already bought this pair, skip to the last part, that is, bonus.sound quality:-pretty good. as you might know, sony is sony when it comes to sound. the audio is clear and has that calm, balanced profile that i prefer to the bass oriented profiles of boat and jbl. if you are a basshead, i don't think these headphones will be your go to. but if you've been using bass heavy headphones, you will feel and instant change in audio quality and the overall beauty of music once you switch to a sony device. keep in mind that i'm not a professional audiophile or something. i love listening to quality music and watching movies and these headphones are perfect. i use apple music and the sound is bliss, idk about spotify though but i think it will fare equally well. i like bass and these headphones do provide bass, just that they are not overkill and distort the entire sound looking for it. these feel more premium in the sound department. however some people might feel a lack of excitement in their sound out of the box. worry not, i've added an eq tweak to fix your problem at the end of this review.specs:-30mm drivers. so not as loud as the 40mm ones boat and jbl offer in this price range. but i've felt (personally) the audio quality to be better. bluetooth 5.2 which is solid. multipoint connection makes sure that this will not be outdated soon. they've been released in 2023 and will remain in contention for atleast a couple of years. multipoint has to be turned on in headphones app and i use it to connect the headphones to my macbook to watch movies and to my android phone, which might be on charging or in another room, to attend calls. the switching is seamless and works well. they don't have touch controls though, so it will take a couple of tries to learn to get the buttons right, especially in a dark room. they have dsee which is basically a feature to enhance low quality/ compressed audios downloaded from internet. it has to be turned on in the app and is not needed for spotify or apple music as they are already best quality music and dsee takes up additional battery charge. battery is solid. they were 70% out of the box and after 20 hr playback still had 50% left. so i guess they'll last for atleast 50 hrs like they claim on the box. i don't like charging my devices all the time and i use them for max 5 hrs a day for which they will last close to 2 weeks which is good. no anc though, it's not a problem for me but if it is for you, don't buy. mic is good, i've attended calls in the midst of traffic and they were pretty fine.comfort:-i've tried many midrange headphones and these are some of the best in terms of comfort too. soft earcups that sit compact on my ear. however if they are not positioned properly, they might exert pressure. but on proper positioning, they will give 2 to 2.5 hours playback without any discomfort. after that you will have to take a break. i don't have big ears btw. they are lightweight and have an adjustable headband with cushion. so as far as on ear headphones are concerned, these are comfortable.build:-plastic but feels durable. not creaking. the earcups are the types which forms wrinkles, they look durable but i don't know if they will pinch unless i use it for atleast 6 months. anyway these have replacement earcups available online and in sony service centers. i have one near my house. i don't think they are sweat resistant so don't use it for workouts. for jogging they will stay in place once positioned compactly, but for running they will slip off ear.drawbacks:-lack of aux cable. once you are out of charge, that's that. it says they support fast charging on box, but i haven't tried that so idk. normally takes 2 hours atleast to charge from 20 to 100. another drawback is portability. they are not foldable and even though the plastic feels durable, i'd suggest you don't bump them much. while travelling either buy a case or carry them around in the box they come with (don't worry about looking cheap, the box doesn't have anything like specs or other bs written on it. only thing written is sony. it's inside the white cover that mentions specs).conclusion:-they offer value for money if you ask me. the sound is premium for a budget segment and not too bass oriented. the headphone app means it will get firmware updates and has some listening modes that actually work, it is not a gimmick. they look and feel premium too. and unlike anker or ath, they have service centers all over so if any issue pops up, that's an added boost too. the don't have an in box warranty card but worry not, the moment you connect your device to the headphones app they are registered. keep the amazon invoice with you, in the box or download it in pdf form from your orders section.bonus:-if the headphones lack excitement to you out of the box, the headphones app offer some preset eq. but i will share this tweak i found from reddit. they worked for me so if you don't know how to configure the eq on your own, try this;select manual on eq in sony headphones app.put 400 to 2.put 1k to 4.put 2.5k to 7.put 6.3k to 7.put 16k to 5.put clear bass to 2.try out this tweak and see if it works for you. this works on some higher end sony models too. enjoy your headphones!!!read more; so if you're considering to buy this pair of headphones or have

from reddit. they worked for me so if you don't know how to configure the eq on your own, try this;select manual on eq in sony headphones app.put 400 to 2.put 1k to 4.put 2.5k to 7.put 6.3k to 7.put 16k to 5.put clear bass to 2.try out this tweak and see if it works for you. this works on some higher end sony models too. enjoy your headphones!!!; pros:1) the sound quality is good.2) if you are looking for decent headset which has all amenities.3) connectivity and functionality is fine and its compatible with ios as well which is great!!!!4) battery as of now hasnt had any problem.cons:1) the noise cancellation could have been better.2) the headset does not suit for everyone in terms of head size. these are fine only with the person having smaller or average size.3) it doesnt suit for gaming.4) sound mixture of high and low can be designed well as i feel its flat in few places where it could have been better.read more; pros:1) the sound quality is good.2) if you are looking for

reuniones virtuales y hay días en que los traigo puestos tal vez 5 o 6 horas seguidas sin quitármelos y no me molestan, a veces hasta se me olvida que los traigo. excelente conectividad bluetooth con el celular y laptop, se pueden conectar ambos a la vez. en el gimnasio los he usado corriendo y haciendo todo tipo de ejercicios y son cómodos, ligeros y no se mueven. los he sudado y la cubierta de las almohadillas no se ha dañado nada. el audio es buenísimo, muy bien nivelado y aunque no tienen cancelación de ruido, con un volumen moderado y por las mismas almohadillas, aisla lo suficientemente bien como para que los ruidos o música del gimnasio, por ejemplo, queden muy en el fondo. nunca ha sido necesario subir al máximo el volumen. además con la app puedes ecualizar a tu gusto, también recomiendo, si usas spotify, ecualizar ahí para tener la mejor experiencia posible. la batería dura muchísimo, en 3 meses de uso usándolos en promedio 3 o 4 horas diarias y solo los he puesto a cargar 3 veces. cargan muy rápido también. el único detalle que les he encontrado es que con mi smarttv hisense, jugando playstation tiene un delay de medio segundo o 1 segundo, y con youtube cada 40 segundos o 1 minuto ""se brinca"" o ""se come"" como 1 segundo tanto del audio como del video. pero para mi no ha sido problema porque realmente solo los uso para escuchar música desde mi celular y para tener llamadas de trabajo. en resumen, son cómodos, lucen bien, sobrios y de buena calidad, muy buen audio y excelente rendimiento de batería.read more; muy cómodos, en mi trabajo participo en

had thse headphones, for two months now, for the gym and i still have not charged them since the day i got them. i cannot say enough.; the product arrived well packaged.  there was a delivery delay but it was not horrendous and to be expected given that it was ordered during parime days,the headphones arrived almost fully charged,  set up was relatively easy, but you really do need to use their app to complete the set up process.  the app also allows you to change some settings and select equalizer settings that work for you.the switches have a nice feel to them.  they do have raised areas designed to help you find the correct switch by feel.  there are times however when i find that it is easier to adjust the volume using the phone or i remove the headphone to make a change.  this is a very subjective items so you may not have the same issue.  no stars were deducted for that reason.these are an on ear device.  it was not uncomfortable to me, but it did take some getting used to and here again...personal preference comes into play.  on a warm and humid day you may experience some sweating where the ear cup rides on your ear.  that may allow for some movement / shifting of the headphone depending on what you are doing.  they may thus not work out well for use doing exercising as an example.the sound quality is great at this price point.  i have bose ear buds.  the sound from this device is not bose quality and you should not expect it to be bose quality.  it is good to very good however.  the equalizer settings allow you to control all five typical equalizer settings plus a separate adjustment for th4 bass.paring was easy and fast.  the connection remains stable most of the time.  there is a selection that allows you to select either top quality sound or a more stable connection.  i chose sound quality an the vast majority of the time the connection was stable with no noise present.  there may be times however, that due to local conditions / interference you may have a little popping or very brief drop out.  i have worn these headphones a lot since they arrived and while i have experienced that, it was very limited.  now i also have a lot of electric / electronic devices in use on my property and that will may explain what i experienced.  i did have some interference from some household devices when i wass very close to them.the battery life seems to be very good.  i have worn m for several hours and the voice system still indicates 100% at startup. unlike my bose products the battery monitoring system is not linear where it will call out 100%, 90%, 80%b etc...  it may call out 100% until the battery hits 50% (as an example) and then te voice system will drop from stating 100% to 50%.  i do not see that as an issue or negative given the very long stated by the manufacturer battery life, and i have no disagreement with their claims about battery life aty this point in time,so again...thus far i am very pleased with the fit, quality, and sound quality of these headphones.  do bed aware that tey are not noise cancelling.  there will be some outside noise reduction dur to the ear cups of course.read more; the product arrived well

if you're considering to buy this pair of headphones or have already brought it and need a little tweak to the sound to up the excitement, give this review a read. i know it's somewhat lengthy :( but if you've already bought this pair, skip to the last part, that is, bonus.sound quality:-pretty good. as you might know, sony is sony when it comes to sound. the audio is clear and has that calm, balanced profile that i prefer to the bass oriented profiles of boat and jbl. if you are a basshead, i don't think these headphones will be your go to. but if you've been using bass heavy headphones, you will feel and instant change in audio quality and the overall beauty of music once you switch to a sony device. keep in mind that i'm not a professional audiophile or something. i love listening to quality music and watching movies and these headphones are perfect. i use apple music and the sound is bliss, idk about spotify though but i think it will fare equally well. i like bass and these headphones do provide bass, just that they are not overkill and distort the entire sound looking for it. these feel more premium in the sound department. however some people might feel a lack of excitement in their sound out of the box. worry not, i've added an eq tweak to fix your problem at the end of this review.specs:-30mm drivers. so not as loud as the 40mm ones boat and jbl offer in this price range. but i've felt (personally) the audio quality to be better. bluetooth 5.2 which is solid. multipoint connection makes sure that this will not be outdated soon. they've been released in 2023 and will remain in contention for atleast a couple of years. multipoint has to be turned on in headphones app and i use it to connect the headphones to my macbook to watch movies and to my android phone, which might be on charging or in another room, to attend calls. the switching is seamless and works well. they don't have touch controls though, so it will take a couple of tries to learn to get the buttons right, especially in a dark room. they have dsee which is basically a feature to enhance low quality/ compressed audios downloaded from internet. it has to be turned on in the app and is not needed for spotify or apple music as they are already best quality music and dsee takes up additional battery charge. battery is solid. they were 70% out of the box and after 20 hr playback still had 50% left. so i guess they'll last for atleast 50 hrs like they claim on the box. i don't like charging my devices all the time and i use them for max 5 hrs a day for which they will last close to 2 weeks which is good. no anc though, it's not a problem for me but if it is for you, don't buy. mic is good, i've attended calls in the midst of traffic and they were pretty fine.comfort:-i've tried many midrange headphones and these are some of the best in terms of comfort too. soft earcups that sit compact on my ear. however if they are not positioned properly, they might exert pressure. but on proper positioning, they will give 2 to 2.5 hours playback without any discomfort. after that you will have to take a break. i don't have big ears btw. they are lightweight and have an adjustable headband with cushion. so as far as on ear headphones are concerned, these are comfortable.build:-plastic but feels durable. not creaking. the earcups are the types which forms wrinkles, they look durable but i don't know if they will pinch unless i use it for atleast 6 months. anyway these have replacement earcups available online and in sony service centers. i have one near my house. i don't think they are sweat resistant so don't use it for workouts. for jogging they will stay in place once positioned compactly, but for running they will slip off ear.drawbacks:-lack of aux cable. once you are out of charge, that's that. it says they support fast charging on box, but i haven't tried that so idk. normally takes 2 hours atleast to charge from 20 to 100. another drawback is portability. they are not foldable and even though the plastic feels durable, i'd suggest you don't bump them much. while travelling either buy a case or carry them around in the box they come with (don't worry about looking cheap, the box doesn't have anything like specs or other bs written on it. only thing written is sony. it's inside the white cover that mentions specs).conclusion:-they offer value for money if you ask me. the sound is premium for a budget segment and not too bass oriented. the headphone app means it will get firmware updates and has some listening modes that actually work, it is not a gimmick. they look and feel premium too. and unlike anker or ath, they have service centers all over so if any issue pops up, that's an added boost too. the don't have an in box warranty card but worry not, the moment you connect your device to the headphones app they are registered. keep the amazon invoice with you, in the box or download it in pdf form from your orders section.bonus:-if the headphones lack excitement to you out of the box, the headphones app offer some preset eq. but i will share this tweak i found from reddit. they worked for me so if you don't know how to configure the eq on your own, try this;select manual on eq in sony headphones app.put 400 to 2.put 1k to 4.put 2.5k to 7.put 6.3k to 7.put 16k to 5.put clear bass to 2.try out this tweak and see if it works for you. this works on some higher end sony models too. enjoy your headphones!!!read more; so if you're considering to buy this pair of headphones or have

think it will fare equally well. i like bass and these headphones do provide bass, just that they are not overkill and distort the entire sound looking for it. these feel more premium in the sound department. however some people might feel a lack of excitement in their sound out of the box. worry not, i've added an eq tweak to fix your problem at the end of this review.specs:-30mm drivers. so not as loud as the 40mm ones boat and jbl offer in this price range. but i've felt (personally) the audio quality to be better. bluetooth 5.2 which is solid. multipoint connection makes sure that this will not be outdated soon. they've been released in 2023 and will remain in contention for atleast a couple of years. multipoint has to be turned on in headphones app and i use it to connect the headphones to my macbook to watch movies and to my android phone, which might be on charging or in another room, to attend calls. the switching is seamless and works well. they don't have touch controls though, so it will take a couple of tries to learn to get the buttons right, especially in a dark room. they have dsee which is basically a feature to enhance low quality/ compressed audios downloaded from internet. it has to be turned on in the app and is not needed for spotify or apple music as they are already best quality music and dsee takes up additional battery charge. battery is solid. they were 70% out of the box and after 20 hr playback still had 50% left. so i guess they'll last for atleast 50 hrs like they claim on the box. i don't like charging my devices all the time and i use them for max 5 hrs a day for which they will last close to 2 weeks which is good. no anc though, it's not a problem for me but if it is for you, don't buy. mic is good, i've attended calls in the midst of traffic and they were pretty fine.comfort:-i've tried many midrange headphones and these are some of the best in terms of comfort too. soft earcups that sit compact on my ear. however if they are not positioned properly, they might exert pressure. but on proper positioning, they will give 2 to 2.5 hours playback without any discomfort. after that you will have to take a break. i don't have big ears btw. they are lightweight and have an adjustable headband with cushion. so as far as on ear headphones are concerned, these are comfortable.build:-plastic but feels durable. not creaking. the earcups are the types which forms wrinkles, they look durable but i don't know if they will pinch unless i use it for atleast 6 months. anyway these have replacement earcups available online and in sony service centers. i have one near my house. i don't think they are sweat resistant so don't use it for workouts. for jogging they will stay in place once positioned compactly, but for running they will slip off ear.drawbacks:-lack of aux cable. once you are out of charge, that's that. it says they support fast charging on box, but i haven't tried that so idk. normally takes 2 hours atleast to charge from 20 to 100. another drawback is portability. they are not foldable and even though the plastic feels durable, i'd suggest you don't bump them much. while travelling either buy a case or carry them around in the box they come with (don't worry about looking cheap, the box doesn't have anything like specs or other bs written on it. only thing written is sony. it's inside the white cover that mentions specs).conclusion:-they offer value for money if you ask me. the sound is premium for a budget segment and not too bass oriented. the headphone app means it will get firmware updates and has some listening modes that actually work, it is not a gimmick. they look and feel premium too. and unlike anker or ath, they have service centers all over so if any issue pops up, that's an added boost too. the don't have an in box warranty card but worry not, the moment you connect your device to the headphones app they are registered. keep the amazon invoice with you, in the box or download it in pdf form from your orders section.bonus:-if the headphones lack excitement to you out of the box, the headphones app offer some preset eq. but i will share this tweak i found from reddit. they worked for me so if you don't know how to configure the eq on your own, try this;select manual on eq in sony headphones app.put 400 to 2.put 1k to 4.put 2.5k to 7.put 6.3k to 7.put 16k to 5.put clear bass to 2.try out this tweak and see if it works for you. this works on some higher end sony models too. enjoy your headphones!!!; pros:1) the sound quality is good.2) if you are looking for decent headset which has all amenities.3) connectivity and functionality is fine and its compatible with ios as well which is great!!!!4) battery as of now hasnt had any problem.cons:1) the noise cancellation could have been better.2) the headset does not suit for everyone in terms of head size. these are fine only with the person having smaller or average size.3) it doesnt suit for gaming.4) sound mixture of high and low can be designed well as i feel its flat in few places where it could have been better.read more; pros:1) the sound quality is good.2) if you are looking for

reuniones virtuales y hay días en que los traigo puestos tal vez 5 o 6 horas seguidas sin quitármelos y no me molestan, a veces hasta se me olvida que los traigo. excelente conectividad bluetooth con el celular y laptop, se pueden conectar ambos a la vez. en el gimnasio los he usado corriendo y haciendo todo tipo de ejercicios y son cómodos, ligeros y no se mueven. los he sudado y la cubierta de las almohadillas no se ha dañado nada. el audio es buenísimo, muy bien nivelado y aunque no tienen cancelación de ruido, con un volumen moderado y por las mismas almohadillas, aisla lo suficientemente bien como para que los ruidos o música del gimnasio, por ejemplo, queden muy en el fondo. nunca ha sido necesario subir al máximo el volumen. además con la app puedes ecualizar a tu gusto, también recomiendo, si usas spotify, ecualizar ahí para tener la mejor experiencia posible. la batería dura muchísimo, en 3 meses de uso usándolos en promedio 3 o 4 horas diarias y solo los he puesto a cargar 3 veces. cargan muy rápido también. el único detalle que les he encontrado es que con mi smarttv hisense, jugando playstation tiene un delay de medio segundo o 1 segundo, y con youtube cada 40 segundos o 1 minuto ""se brinca"" o ""se come"" como 1 segundo tanto del audio como del video. pero para mi no ha sido problema porque realmente solo los uso para escuchar música desde mi celular y para tener llamadas de trabajo. en resumen, son cómodos, lucen bien, sobrios y de buena calidad, muy buen audio y excelente rendimiento de batería.read more; muy cómodos, en mi trabajo participo en

app to complete the set up process.  the app also allows you to change some settings and select equalizer settings that work for you.the switches have a nice feel to them.  they do have raised areas designed to help you find the correct switch by feel.  there are times however when i find that it is easier to adjust the volume using the phone or i remove the headphone to make a change.  this is a very subjective items so you may not have the same issue.  no stars were deducted for that reason.these are an on ear device.  it was not uncomfortable to me, but it did take some getting used to and here again...personal preference comes into play.  on a warm and humid day you may experience some sweating where the ear cup rides on your ear.  that may allow for some movement / shifting of the headphone depending on what you are doing.  they may thus not work out well for use doing exercising as an example.the sound quality is great at this price point.  i have bose ear buds.  the sound from this device is not bose quality and you should not expect it to be bose quality.  it is good to very good however.  the equalizer settings allow you to control all five typical equalizer settings plus a separate adjustment for th4 bass.paring was easy and fast.  the connection remains stable most of the time.  there is a selection that allows you to select either top quality sound or a more stable connection.  i chose sound quality an the vast majority of the time the connection was stable with no noise present.  there may be times however, that due to local conditions / interference you may have a little popping or very brief drop out.  i have worn these headphones a lot since they arrived and while i have experienced that, it was very limited.  now i also have a lot of electric / electronic devices in use on my property and that will may explain what i experienced.  i did have some interference from some household devices when i wass very close to them.the battery life seems to be very good.  i have worn m for several hours and the voice system still indicates 100% at startup. unlike my bose products the battery monitoring system is not linear where it will call out 100%, 90%, 80%b etc...  it may call out 100% until the battery hits 50% (as an example) and then te voice system will drop from stating 100% to 50%.  i do not see that as an issue or negative given the very long stated by the manufacturer battery life, and i have no disagreement with their claims about battery life aty this point in time,so again...thus far i am very pleased with the fit, quality, and

it's also about it being on time, and these earphones deliver that pretty well.comfort & passive noise isolation:comfort is key when it comes to neckbands, and the z2 doesn’t disappoint. they come with multiple earbud sizes, so you can pick the one that fits snugly for you. while there’s no active noise cancellation (anc) here, you can achieve a decent level of passive noise isolation by choosing the right ear tips. this makes a noticeable difference in cutting out background noise during commutes or at the office.app experience & annoying blinking light:now, onto a couple of quirks. the bullets z2 uses the heymelody app, which offers additional features like custom sound settings. however, my unit just wouldn’t connect with the app, which was a bummer. so, any fancy tweaks you could make through the app were out of my reach, and i had to rely solely on the default bluetooth pairing. while everything worked smoothly once connected, i feel like i missed out on some customization options that might have enhanced my experience.another thing that bugged me was the small white light that blinks when the neckband is connected to a device. it might not seem like a big deal, but if you’re using the earphones in a dark room or while lying down, that blinking light can be pretty distracting. plus, it probably drains the battery a bit, albeit a small amount. a simple option to turn this off in the app would’ve been a nice touch.final thoughts - a solid pick for most, with room for improvement:overall, the oneplus z2 delivers where it matters—good sound quality, reliable connectivity, and battery life that won’t have you constantly reaching for the charger. it’s not perfect, especially with the blinking light and app connectivity issues, but those are minor compared to the solid performance it offers. plus, with the quick-charge feature and low-latency gaming experience, it’s hard not to appreciate the value you get.if you’re looking for a reliable neckband that blends style, comfort, and balanced audio, the oneplus bullets z2 is definitely worth considering. it might not satisfy those who crave earth-shattering bass, but for most listeners, it's a worthy contender at its price point.read more;

there is nothing wrong with the looks of the bullets z2, they are actually quite decent looking. they are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. the middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, u shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. the wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. one of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the usb type c port on the side. you get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. the battery unit has the oneplus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.the earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. when the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. the bullets wireless z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. the material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. it also comes with an ip55 rating.pairing the oneplus bullets wireless z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. all you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. you can then look up the buds in the list of bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. once connected, the bullets z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.you get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, oneplus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), oneplus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. you have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. it may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.the oneplus bullets wireless z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of oneplus earphones- 12.4mm. the fact that oneplus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. the earbuds support two audio codecs, sbc and aac.as for the audio performance, the bullets wireless z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. while this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.if you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the bullets wireless z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.that said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the oneplus bullets wireless z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.the oneplus bullets wireless z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. we could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. as the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.they come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. but because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.the bullets wireless z2 also face some heat from the likes of oppo enco m32 and the realme buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. the oneplus bullets wireless z2 are actually a great proposition for the price;

long hours. very good sound quality, if you are confused between two headphones in this budget and you like bass more, then pick this one it has great bass. so everything is good, but there is one major, very big problem which is kinda aceeptable for someone and not for a lot of pepole. the problem is sound leakage, if you listen even above 50% vol or for some songs even at 30% vol, the sound starts to get outside earphone. your experience won't get bad for urself but the outsiders could also hear it which is why its not good to use it in public. if u go on 90% volume, rather than a headphone it becomes a speaker, u won't face any problem in ears, but voice outside will come loud easily hearable. it means brand gave everything, but could not block the speakers towards the outer end meaning voice gets outside easilyread more; great budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together. great build

levels, sometimes distorts a little at high specificly there's a monster mode at that.this is my first over the ear headphone even though the design is comfortable sounds good, i feel separated earphones are more comfortable for long use where as over the ear kind compresses the skull.; 3.5/5i have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. i got it for a nice deal (approx. rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). i was reviewing multiple headphones under the rs. 5k range. my first choice was the sony ch-520, but i did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and i didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under rs. 5k). the other options were boat, zebronics (a different set), hammer and a variety of other ones.among them i did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. i wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. it was available at a reasonable price and the rgb lights impressed me. so i ordered them.pros:- sounds good! i'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. no issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. the bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- sturdy. the headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. while laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. i have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. they are still in good shape- rgb. the lights are definitely funky. they look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- battery. applaudable battery without hesitation. i use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.cons:- mic. i've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. my peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what i just said- huge cushions and ear muffs! the size of the muffs are simply too big. when traveling with the headphones on in buses, i like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. but this is simply not possibly with these headphones. the muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. when i try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. so i'm forced to sit rigid for a while- terrible button placement. the power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. this makes it very hard to use the controls. i have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. it's so ridiculous that i stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- bad usb-c connection slot. the usb-c connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other usb-c wires because it has a narrow deep opening. so my phone's usb-c charger doesn't fit in it. only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. this means i always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackoverall decent pair. in my previous (edited now) review, i mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. after several days i realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. so, i have edited my review and updated the ratingcheers!read more; 3.5/5i have been using these headphones for over 2 months

choice was the sony ch-520, but i did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and i didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under rs. 5k). the other options were boat, zebronics (a different set), hammer and a variety of other ones.among them i did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. i wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. it was available at a reasonable price and the rgb lights impressed me. so i ordered them.pros:- sounds good! i'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. no issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. the bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- sturdy. the headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. while laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. i have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. they are still in good shape- rgb. the lights are definitely funky. they look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- battery. applaudable battery without hesitation. i use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.cons:- mic. i've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. my peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what i just said- huge cushions and ear muffs! the size of the muffs are simply too big. when traveling with the headphones on in buses, i like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. but this is simply not possibly with these headphones. the muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. when i try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. so i'm forced to sit rigid for a while- terrible button placement. the power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. this makes it very hard to use the controls. i have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. it's so ridiculous that i stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- bad usb-c connection slot. the usb-c connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other usb-c wires because it has a narrow deep opening. so my phone's usb-c charger doesn't fit in it. only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. this means i always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackoverall decent pair. in my previous (edited now) review, i mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. after several days i realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. so, i have edited my review and updated the ratingcheers!; وصلتني الكرتون مفتوح وقماش

surprisingly exceeded my expectations. although i am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. there is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. which is a pity, but ah well. can't have it all, can ya?best bluetooth headphones at 799 for sound and mic quality. and let's not forget comfort. headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.even though i have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. so if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these. but if you don't mind going for earphones, then there are many better options available in terms of sound quality.read more;

these headphones are good for the price but there is only one major problem that is comfort...i mean that you will not be able to wear them for long sessions otherwise it's overall a banger considering it's price. the mic is good, i tested the mic on discord and calls...it's pretty well. battery is superb as it's been two days since i they were 100% and now when am writing this review.....it's still at 90%. sound quality is good. gaming is bit of controversial as some might find it good but lemme tell u one thing that the latency is always not good at this price point but these are good for any story mode games and ok ok for competitive games.hope it helps☺️btw i got them for 800 rs.read more;

these headphones are just bang for the bucks!! im a basic audio enthusiast and an avid music lover.. my personal taste of audio is a mixed one.. i waited so long and after many years sony ultimately launched this ult headphone that perfectly fits my taste of music.. i usually prefer only headphones for listening music and watching movies as they completely cover up your ears and drives powerful audio straight to your sealed ears.. that is a different experience than the in ear or tws ones.. and i definitely need bass without any compromise on mid section, the highs, sound to be rich, clean with decent stereo staging.. this one satisfies all that.. i do use eq to tweak settings for my taste and once setup, hell yeah it is just out of the world!! i dont understand why many reviews downplay music quality like mids, highs, crispness, stereo staging etc but this one does all that with that massive bass too!! either there are headphones with rich audio clarity but lacks on bass or there are the other bassy ones that makes other aspects sound trash.. but this one for me is an all rounder.. music which has only rich vocals, string sections without much bass lines too sound soo good same as music with immersive bass.. by bass i dont mean just the upper bass which gives you headache but the really low end rumbles extending deeper to sub 20hz or even less which you can actually feel.. i feel like im in an imax theatre or somewhere straight into the studios after i put this up.. even for ppl who dont like bass there is an option to completely switch it off.. for me it works wonders with the first ult mode.. that is damn impressive.. everyone whom i asked to listen this was just blown away.. i really love it..i have tried many brands like sennheiser momentum plus (diaphragm distortion) even at moderate volume so returned back, then jbl not satisfied with audio quality though had bass, then some new companies like soniclamb which fakes the bass (no bass less than 40hz or so but will fake with some artificial vibrations) which i threw to trash.. finally this is the real and clean one for my budget..i don't even look into noise cancelling as i mostly listen music only indoors but this actually does a pretty good job and silences the outer noise by almost half.. most of the times i don't even need it indoors..likewise i rarely make calls with this but that is pretty good as well..bluetooth connection and latency is fine for me as i'm not gamer.. connection is very stable and it can connect two devices at once..battery is also pretty good so as the charging time..if i have to speak about some cons, the headphone always runs with noise cancelling mode on by default even if you toggle it through headphone control.. ambient noise mode off does not actually turn off, but the mics work even harder to amplify external noises so that you can hear everything around.. everytime you have to get the app running and set like while detecting as 'staying' then completely turn off noise cancelling feature.. as a person who is not interested much on this aspect i don't have to put this extra load to the headphone and i have to switch it off manually through the app everytime..and i also prefer the headphones to be more louder.. some movies or videos have very low volume and even at highest volume it's not loud enough..but these are manageable and overall i think sony really nailed with this headphone..!!read more;

overall quality of the product is good and worth the money. when it comes to the sound quality that's beyond my expectation. i'm completely satisfied with the sound quality and bass. though this product is specially for bass lovers you can adjust bass level and also use equalizer for music control in the sound connect app by sony. so, this product is not only for bass lovers and also for a music lovers. battery life is too good. i use it for 4-5 hours a day but i charge this product every 10 days so battery backup is good. comfort is too good. i'm using this product for past 15 days and there is no discomfort or any pain in my ears. only problem is sometimes i noted is as it covers your ear so you might get sweat in ears. if you use it in ac room no chance for sweat. so this is what i experienced using this product. hope this experience might help others to take decision.read more;

the boat rockerz line is boat's super cheap lineup for budget buyers. this will likely be many people's first foray into the world of wireless headphones, and is likely to turn many people off by its many compromises. it might be worth buying your grandma as a gift, but is  not something i'd ever recommend buying for your own use.1. sound quality - awful. honestly, the boat rockerz 450 does little more than bring your phone's audio loser to your ears. it isn't any significant improvement over your phone's speaker, and might actually be an active downgrade from your computer's speakers. most audio sounds tinny, there's little to no bass, and absolutely zero noise cancellation. on or off, you can and will hear the outside world. those who carry wireless headphones to tune out the outside world on walks or airplanes will be sorely disappointed. the soundstage is very small and shallow, and even non-audiophiles will notice the poor sound quality.2. comfort - horrendous. the boat rockerz 450 is a pain to wear, both literally and figuratively. the audio sounds horrible, and your ears will feel horrible too after an hour of use, maybe less. the good battery life means nothing if you cant use these headphones for more than 45 minutes at a time. after removing these headphones, your ears will hurt for a long while, and you'll feel like never wearing these again. the cans are very small, even for on-ear headphones, and people with spectacles or large heads will be even worse off. the frame doesn't extend very far, and also slips down quite easily.3. build quality - in a word - bad. see a pattern here? the headphones reflect their low price point, and are  entirely made of cheap plastic. the plastic also doesn't flex much, and the headphones seem very easy to break by accident. it's worth noting that the cups don't extend much. if you're one of those guys who like to leave their headphones dangling around their neck when not in use, you'll find yourself unable to lower your head without your headphones biting into your jaw. finally, the cups absorb a lot of sweat. you'l find yourself wanting to wash the cups and frustrated that you can't. it's really gross.5. mic - absolutely trash tier. you won't even be able to use the mic for how bad it is. i honestly forgot these headphones even had a mic because it's so soft and picks up so much background noise. callers will not be able to hear you clearly and will keep urging you to switch back to your phone, and you can forget about trying to use these with your pc for voice chat or conference calls. don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a mic with this headset - the mic only exists on paper. it's really not worth using.4. final words - just, don't. spend a bit more, get a decent pair of wireless headphones. the headset doesn't even connect properly half the time, and when it does, you'll wish it didn't. save  up some money, work at mcdonalds, and treat yourself to some good headphones. anything, but not these ones. the only good thing about these cans is the battery life, but what use it battery life if you don't want to use these headphones?1 buildread more;

to start the review i had received the product with a defect. i am not sure if it was thru the distributor or seller that i received it defected as i was getting a lot of issues with the left anc not working at all as the right side and also felt the music quality was an issue. i had got assistance from online sonova team help wherein i shipped my product to service center in delhi and received a brand new replaced product.thats when listening to the true music clarity with proper anc made me feel this is a worth buy and happy with the product.very important feature is the music clarity a class with a good equaliser option for manual adjustments thru the app.craziest of all is the damn battery life never seems to need charging like hardly once or twice a week max to charge depending how many hours of usage. its crazy to have that feeling what a good battery life with just an hr max 2 for full charge.anc works very well yes sony must be better a notch higher but happy with the perfect price range.in the past i have purchased dr dre studio, sony wf1000xm4 and now had to test sennheiser.happy to have purchased this sennheiser.read more;

le cuffie sennheiser momentum 4 wireless sono veramente ottime per coloro che cercano una qualità audio ottima, insieme a tanta autonomia. si possono anche usare cablate con il cavo in dotazione e offrono una custodia per portarle in giro. il timbro risulta improntato sui bassi, ma senza esagerare; colpisce come i suoni degli strumenti musicali, le voci si riescano a distinguere in maniera cristallina quasi come se i musicisti stessero suonando vicino a te.1)vengono spesso paragonate alle sony xm5 come fascia di prezzo, in realtà l'unica cosa che le xm5 hanno di superiore è la cancellazione del rumore; ma questo non significa che le momentum non abbiano una buona cancellazione del rumore, anzi è più che sufficiente per quello che può essere un uso giornaliero moderato.2)il prezzo può essere considerato da molti elevato, però la firma di sennheiser giustifica l'alta qualità di queste cuffie; l'uso bluetooth di queste non mi ha fatto notare interferenze, rumore e fastidi a livello della qualità audio. oggettivamente il prezzo >200-250 è giustificato.3)l'app per telefono offre diverse configurazioni e modalità di personalizzazione, sebbene esistano cuffie per audiofili sicuramente migliori, mi sento di dire che a questo prezzo valgono veramente la pena.4)i comandi touch sono davvero comodi e precisi, consentono di passare da modalità ambiente che ti fa sentire all'esterno e alla classica modalità delle cuffie.ho letto che molti le hanno restituite, giusto perché la musica è di tutti, ma non per tutti.read more;

i just received these sennheiser momentum 4 cans about 7 days ago. i bought them for $270, and now i see you can get them $20 less. i made the purchase, despite the negative reviews posted on amazon simply because i have learned that reviews don't tell the whole story. such as often times when it comes to bluetooth devices, there will be a new firware/update that will need to be done, depending on how old the product is. in my case, that was the case. the firmware update was easy, took maybe a minute or two, and i was off and running. i have owned, and sold several headsets, from jbl, beats, skullcandy, sony and yes, bose. now, for me, and how i like my music to sound, the sennheiser 4s are by far the best sounding bluetooth headphone to grace my melon. mids, highs and lows work amazingly well. wind and string instruments sound crisp, and suppurb! the lows/bass work harmoniously with the above mentioned. the sennheiser equalizer is easy to use, and gets the job done. touch controls: they take getting used to, but, once you adapt, it works great. yes, at times you may pause music when touching the right ear cup, but again, you will adapt and recover. comfort. these cans are extremely comfortable.  even for my large head. ear cushions are comfy, as is the head cushion. could it use more cushion? maybe if you wear them for 8 hrs straight. weight. yes, they way a tad bit more than the competition, but, that is to be expected as the battery is slightly larger...hence why you can get up to 60hrs of life on these bad boys! the cans don't feel cheap, they feel solid. and that is something i can appreciate. are these cans perfect? they are as close to perfect that you will get (imho) on bluetooth headsets. are there better cans out there? sure, if you go wired, and spend a few hundred more, then yes. even sennheiser wired headsets (depending what model you get) are better, but that's because they are wired. of course they will sound better.one thing i didn't discuss is noise canceling. they get the job done in fine fashion. i have tried the sony 5s, and they are slightly better than the senn 4s. i have made several phones calls, facetime calls and the voice activation works wonderfully! i am 7000+ miles away from home, and not one complaint on how i sound, or, how the other end sounds. lastly, battery life. it claims you can get 60hrs of life once fully charged. that is a fact, as i have tested that claim and  59+ hours the first charge, not quite there for the second charge.  mind you, it will lose an hour or two depending on what you have activated.accessories.  well, you can listen to these cans wired, especially if you run out of charge. you will need a dongle (i purchased one from amazon) and they sound great. it will sound different,  and you may need to adjust you equalizer.  the case the cans come with is a solid, good quality case with charging type c cable, 3.5 wired jack, and an airplane adaptor to plug your cable into so you can listen to  movies or music that the plane is playing.  and it all is neatly stored within the case.final thoughts:i honestly feel that alot of the issues that some people reviewed on amazon is these headsets  have ""buggy"" issues, or connectivity issues. perhaps some just don't know how to do firmware updates, the phone they are using is dated? not sure, all i know is mine cans fired right up, and i did the update straight away. these cans have bluetooth 5.2, so it should be able to connect to any device that's out there currently. yes, touch panel does take some getting used to. much like driving a truck, then driving a sport car. it may take a moment to get familiar with the vehicle,  but once you do, it's a piece of cake.i decided to take a chance, i did my research outside of amazon reviews, and watched the pros on youtube, and that's how i ended up buying these. big risk considering i am a world away. give em a try, you can always return them if they aren't for you.read more;

these are really great headphone, highly recommend these. super handy to be connected to 2 devices at once as i use these for work between laptop and phone but these also are great for the gym with the noise cancellation to block out the music there. very minimal movement when working out which is great as this was one of my concerns before purchasing.so comfortable i forget i'm wearing them, for anyone prone to migranes like me these aren't likely to cause one.read more;

i currently own the sennheiser momentum 3 (m3) headphones, but i need an additional pair to replace my old, reliable momentum 2 (m2), which unfortunately has a battery issue. even after replacing the battery, the m2 still doesn’t work wirelessly.initially, i thought there wasn’t much difference between the m3 and the momentum 4 (m4) in terms of sound quality, as both have the same 42mm driver. however, after switching the bluetooth codec to aptx adaptive, which supports high bitrate, i noticed a significant improvement in sound quality while listening to music on youtube. despite youtube not being the best audio source, the sound became clearer with resonant bass. although i’m not an expert, i really enjoy the sound, making the m4 a worthwhile upgrade from the m3.the m4 boasts a 60-hour battery life, a touchpad, increased comfort, significantly improved active noise cancellation (anc), and support for aptx adaptive, which is comparable to sony’s ldac codec. on the other hand, my sony wh-1000xm3 and xm4 support ldac but don’t deliver the same high-quality sound. we appreciate sony for its anc and comfort, but not for its sound quality. in our opinion, the bose quietcomfort 35 and the new quietcomfort models offer better sound quality than sony, though they lack the bass presence of the m3 and m4. if we were to consider another pair of headphones, we would likely choose the bose qc ultra due to its support for aptx adaptive.ultimately, it comes down to personal preference. i prefer sennheiser for its sound quality, while my wife prefers bose for its comfort and superior anc. it’s fortunate that we don’t prefer the same headphones!read more;

i'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment i experienced with the noise two wirless. these headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.let's start with the build quality. imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. they weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.now, i'm a reasonable person. accidents happen. so, i contacted noise support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. what i got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. they dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).so, here i am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. the audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. my advice? steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.for those seeking a more constructive alternative:do your research! read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.prioritize build quality. look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.understand the warranty terms thoroughly. don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.read more;

i’ve been using the boat rockerz 430 for about a week now, and i’m honestly pretty impressed. for the price, you really can’t beat it. the sound quality is excellent, with rich bass and clear highs, which is perfect for music, movies, and even gaming. the beast mode with 40ms low latency is a great touch, making gaming feel smooth and immersive without any lag.battery life is another highlight – it lasts up to 40 hours, so i’ve been able to use them for days without charging. the adaptive fit is comfortable too, even for long listening sessions, and the headphones feel lightweight yet sturdy.another great feature is the environmental noise cancelling , which makes calls crystal clear by reducing background noise. i’ve also found the voice assistant activation really convenient for multitasking. overall, these headphones deliver amazing value for money. if you’re looking for a budget-friendly, high-quality pair of bluetooth headphones, i’d highly recommend the boat rockerz 430!read more;

it's also about it being on time, and these earphones deliver that pretty well.comfort & passive noise isolation:comfort is key when it comes to neckbands, and the z2 doesn’t disappoint. they come with multiple earbud sizes, so you can pick the one that fits snugly for you. while there’s no active noise cancellation (anc) here, you can achieve a decent level of passive noise isolation by choosing the right ear tips. this makes a noticeable difference in cutting out background noise during commutes or at the office.app experience & annoying blinking light:now, onto a couple of quirks. the bullets z2 uses the heymelody app, which offers additional features like custom sound settings. however, my unit just wouldn’t connect with the app, which was a bummer. so, any fancy tweaks you could make through the app were out of my reach, and i had to rely solely on the default bluetooth pairing. while everything worked smoothly once connected, i feel like i missed out on some customization options that might have enhanced my experience.another thing that bugged me was the small white light that blinks when the neckband is connected to a device. it might not seem like a big deal, but if you’re using the earphones in a dark room or while lying down, that blinking light can be pretty distracting. plus, it probably drains the battery a bit, albeit a small amount. a simple option to turn this off in the app would’ve been a nice touch.final thoughts - a solid pick for most, with room for improvement:overall, the oneplus z2 delivers where it matters—good sound quality, reliable connectivity, and battery life that won’t have you constantly reaching for the charger. it’s not perfect, especially with the blinking light and app connectivity issues, but those are minor compared to the solid performance it offers. plus, with the quick-charge feature and low-latency gaming experience, it’s hard not to appreciate the value you get.if you’re looking for a reliable neckband that blends style, comfort, and balanced audio, the oneplus bullets z2 is definitely worth considering. it might not satisfy those who crave earth-shattering bass, but for most listeners, it's a worthy contender at its price point.read more;

there is nothing wrong with the looks of the bullets z2, they are actually quite decent looking. they are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. the middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, u shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. the wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. one of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the usb type c port on the side. you get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. the battery unit has the oneplus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.the earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. when the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. the bullets wireless z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. the material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. it also comes with an ip55 rating.pairing the oneplus bullets wireless z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. all you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. you can then look up the buds in the list of bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. once connected, the bullets z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.you get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, oneplus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), oneplus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. you have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. it may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.the oneplus bullets wireless z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of oneplus earphones- 12.4mm. the fact that oneplus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. the earbuds support two audio codecs, sbc and aac.as for the audio performance, the bullets wireless z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. while this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.if you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the bullets wireless z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.that said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the oneplus bullets wireless z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.the oneplus bullets wireless z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. we could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. as the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.they come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. but because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.the bullets wireless z2 also face some heat from the likes of oppo enco m32 and the realme buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. the oneplus bullets wireless z2 are actually a great proposition for the price;

media could not be loaded.before receiving the product, these were my concerns:-1. alot of reviews were bout how the mic is bad , hence i was concerned.2. worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. cuz i needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.3.comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .4.sturdiness and build quality.5.looks obviously , pictures were good but i didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. not a single concern was founded to be true.1.mic is working absolutely fine. you can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. if you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). for all other purposes its perfect.2.i received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am i switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. it has been playing non stop. its perfect. if you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. you don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). battery life is sufficient. i haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. anyway , by what i've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. very comfortable. its definitely over the ears and completely covers them. even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. also , i dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , i've seen heavier gaming headphones. don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .4.build quality is very nice , sturdy and strong. the speakers are tightly held with the band and while i don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. it loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . the rgb looks so beautiful and catchy. the overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. everything is perfect. though i wish now that i should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... it would've looked cooler with rgb.6. with bluetooth , its justt awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ i like it (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). i don't play games so i can't talk bout latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. now talking bout the wired mode. it might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. the clarity is just perfect and no latency ofcourse. no need of battery in aux mode. can keep using it even if the battery is dead. i like this feature so much. for a student like me , its a charmer. no unnecessary breaks . and with the full sound ☠️ you won't hear even if someone's getting murderrred in the next room ☠️ its that awesome.  sound does leak , but its tooo loud as well. i mean , its like a freakin mini speaker on medium volume when you keep it aside and max the volume. it is crazyyyy . you can just hang it on your neck if it gets too hot n you'll still hear everything.it is honestly my very first wireless headphones. but i have used boat rockerz which my friend has , and i can say without a doubt , giving 200 more for this one is definitely worth it.the comfort , the looks , the loudness , the rgb (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). i even got 129 cashback so it had to be a steal deal for me 😁.i'm so glad i bought this as my first headphones. i was very skeptical but now that i'm using it 😍 , its just a wonderful experience.most negative comments i believe are one in hundred instances or anomaly or exceptions. most people don't review a product till it's defective. only very few people review when the product it perfect.this is to help first timers like me or for anyone who want a good headphone.don't worry bout anything , just go for it. luck can be bad sometimes nd you might get a bad piece , just get it replaced nd voila , problems solved. its not like 100% of manufactured products are bad ☠️. anyway. ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.read more; the media could not be loaded.before receiving the product, these were my concerns:-1. alot of reviews were bout how the mic is bad , hence i was concerned.2. worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. cuz i needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.3.comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .4.sturdiness and build quality.5.looks obviously , pictures were good but i didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. not a single concern was founded to be true.1.mic is working absolutely fine. you can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. if you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). for all other purposes its perfect.2.i received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am i switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. it has been playing non stop. its perfect. if you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. you don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). battery life is sufficient. i haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. anyway , by what i've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. very comfortable. its definitely over the ears and completely covers them. even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. also , i dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , i've seen heavier gaming headphones. don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .4.build quality is very nice , sturdy and strong. the speakers are tightly held with the band and while i don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. it loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . the rgb looks so beautiful and catchy. the overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. everything is perfect. though i wish now that i should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... it would've looked cooler with rgb.6. with bluetooth , its justt awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ i like it (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). i don't play games so i can't talk bout latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. now talking bout the wired mode. it might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. the clarity is just perfect and no latency ofcourse. no need of battery in aux mode. can keep using it even if the battery is dead. i like this feature so much. for a student like me , its a charmer. no unnecessary breaks . and with

put straight for 2 to 3 hours, after it might feel a bit discomfort, depends on person to person. great battery, brand claims 40hr and i get too around 38 to 39hr in it which says its approved for long hours. very good sound quality, if you are confused between two headphones in this budget and you like bass more, then pick this one it has great bass. so everything is good, but there is one major, very big problem which is kinda aceeptable for someone and not for a lot of pepole. the problem is sound leakage, if you listen even above 50% vol or for some songs even at 30% vol, the sound starts to get outside earphone. your experience won't get bad for urself but the outsiders could also hear it which is why its not good to use it in public. if u go on 90% volume, rather than a headphone it becomes a speaker, u won't face any problem in ears, but voice outside will come loud easily hearable. it means brand gave everything, but could not block the speakers towards the outer end meaning voice gets outside easilyread more; great budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together. great build

levels, sometimes distorts a little at high specificly there's a monster mode at that.this is my first over the ear headphone even though the design is comfortable sounds good, i feel separated earphones are more comfortable for long use where as over the ear kind compresses the skull.; 3.5/5i have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. i got it for a nice deal (approx. rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). i was reviewing multiple headphones under the rs. 5k range. my first choice was the sony ch-520, but i did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and i didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under rs. 5k). the other options were boat, zebronics (a different set), hammer and a variety of other ones.among them i did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. i wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. it was available at a reasonable price and the rgb lights impressed me. so i ordered them.pros:- sounds good! i'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. no issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. the bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- sturdy. the headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. while laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. i have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. they are still in good shape- rgb. the lights are definitely funky. they look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- battery. applaudable battery without hesitation. i use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.cons:- mic. i've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. my peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what i just said- huge cushions and ear muffs! the size of the muffs are simply too big. when traveling with the headphones on in buses, i like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. but this is simply not possibly with these headphones. the muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. when i try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. so i'm forced to sit rigid for a while- terrible button placement. the power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. this makes it very hard to use the controls. i have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. it's so ridiculous that i stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- bad usb-c connection slot. the usb-c connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other usb-c wires because it has a narrow deep opening. so my phone's usb-c charger doesn't fit in it. only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. this means i always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackoverall decent pair. in my previous (edited now) review, i mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. after several days i realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. so, i have edited my review and updated the ratingcheers!read more; 3.5/5i have been using these headphones for over 2 months

v good.. sound it reproduce is super.. unlike in-ears no much pain. i use this for 2 to 2.5 day may be 6-7 hours a day.. it's comes with a 3.5mm jack- so you can use it even if you runs out of battery. cushions could have been softer and sweat absorbing- if using in an air conditioned room, this isn't a prob.felt this was little heavier compared to the one i used earlier - sennihiser and sony headphones i used were a little expensive.problem comes if you travel with this-bulk it is.i prefer a foldable over-the head. headbands are adjustable but if you change them frequently plastic will have a wear and tear. fix one position and don't change it frequently.read more;

the boat rockerz line is boat's super cheap lineup for budget buyers. this will likely be many people's first foray into the world of wireless headphones, and is likely to turn many people off by its many compromises. it might be worth buying your grandma as a gift, but is  not something i'd ever recommend buying for your own use.1. sound quality - awful. honestly, the boat rockerz 450 does little more than bring your phone's audio loser to your ears. it isn't any significant improvement over your phone's speaker, and might actually be an active downgrade from your computer's speakers. most audio sounds tinny, there's little to no bass, and absolutely zero noise cancellation. on or off, you can and will hear the outside world. those who carry wireless headphones to tune out the outside world on walks or airplanes will be sorely disappointed. the soundstage is very small and shallow, and even non-audiophiles will notice the poor sound quality.2. comfort - horrendous. the boat rockerz 450 is a pain to wear, both literally and figuratively. the audio sounds horrible, and your ears will feel horrible too after an hour of use, maybe less. the good battery life means nothing if you cant use these headphones for more than 45 minutes at a time. after removing these headphones, your ears will hurt for a long while, and you'll feel like never wearing these again. the cans are very small, even for on-ear headphones, and people with spectacles or large heads will be even worse off. the frame doesn't extend very far, and also slips down quite easily.3. build quality - in a word - bad. see a pattern here? the headphones reflect their low price point, and are  entirely made of cheap plastic. the plastic also doesn't flex much, and the headphones seem very easy to break by accident. it's worth noting that the cups don't extend much. if you're one of those guys who like to leave their headphones dangling around their neck when not in use, you'll find yourself unable to lower your head without your headphones biting into your jaw. finally, the cups absorb a lot of sweat. you'l find yourself wanting to wash the cups and frustrated that you can't. it's really gross.5. mic - absolutely trash tier. you won't even be able to use the mic for how bad it is. i honestly forgot these headphones even had a mic because it's so soft and picks up so much background noise. callers will not be able to hear you clearly and will keep urging you to switch back to your phone, and you can forget about trying to use these with your pc for voice chat or conference calls. don't be fooled into thinking you're getting a mic with this headset - the mic only exists on paper. it's really not worth using.4. final words - just, don't. spend a bit more, get a decent pair of wireless headphones. the headset doesn't even connect properly half the time, and when it does, you'll wish it didn't. save  up some money, work at mcdonalds, and treat yourself to some good headphones. anything, but not these ones. the only good thing about these cans is the battery life, but what use it battery life if you don't want to use these headphones?1 buildread more;

i'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment i experienced with the noise two wirless. these headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.let's start with the build quality. imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. they weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.now, i'm a reasonable person. accidents happen. so, i contacted noise support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. what i got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. they dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).so, here i am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. the audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. my advice? steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.for those seeking a more constructive alternative:do your research! read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.prioritize build quality. look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.understand the warranty terms thoroughly. don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.read more;

lost 2 different pairs of in-ear tws earphones (thankfully cheaper ones) so i decided to buy something large and harder to lose (lol). it was between this and the bose qc45 for me. my primary headphones for 8 years now are the audio technica ath-m50x which are a solid pair of wired neutral headphones, so i'll use those as a reference for audio quality.short read: why i picked this over the bose qc45 - sounds marginally better overall (with loads of room in the low end for those who like heavy bass), equally comfortable, better battery life, better app/customisability, and also a bit more discreet. i don't want people knowing i'm carrying around pricey headphones so i'd rather have a pair of plain looking sonys than a bose pair that screams expensive. also, the carrying case is actually pretty great and protects these well. i wear these headphones everywhere, even at the gym.- amazing battery: ldac + dsee extreme on gives me a full week of use with 2-3 hours of use per day, at around 60-70% volume. nice to not have to worry about charging these all the time (uses usb-c).- audio: super weird out of the box- very boomy and muddy low-mids. i eqd this and it went from sounding like an average set to an incredible one. it's just a bit bizarre to me that they'd hamstring this pair so severely out of the box when they're capable of so much more.it has great frequency response and articulation, you'll hear tons of detail once it is set up right, so credit to the drivers they're using. i'm including an eq preset for your reference, which should be good for blues, jazz, folk, country, and classical (anything with nice vocals). compared to the m50x, they have much better bass so anyone into edm will like this set as well.- comfort: they're wonderfully comfortable. super light, doesn't clamp your head or ears, and you can wear them for hours. the cushions are soft and don't hurt your ears. orders of magnitude more comfortable than my m50x, and easily the best other than the bose qc line. you'll forget you're wearing them, they're that neat.- anc: they completely block out low hums and noises coming from fans, acs, and in-flight rumble, even with no music playing. makes sense since they seem to be designed primarily as travel/commute headphones. voices and other sounds can still kinda be heard but are drowned out if you're listening to music at anything above 30-40% volume. i don't think it's meant to block out these sounds, so i'm not particular about it. i can sit through an entire flight and hear nothing, which by itself is completely worth it to me.- multipoint: works as advertised, i was able to use it fine with my samsung galaxy phone and macbook pro upon testing. i don't use this feature though since i prefer ldac and that is only possible with multi-point off. however if mp is useful for you, know that it works pretty seamlessly.conclusion: if you can afford these headphones, i would easily recommend them to you. they sound genuinely amazing for a wireless closed back pair, are very customisable, comfortable, and the battery lasts for days, literally. the anc is best-in-class and made for frequent travelers. it's one of those things that will last you years and years of use if you look after them. they also go on sale quite frequently, so wait for one before you buy (i got it for inr ~15,500). it's rare that i spend this much on a luxury item and still consider it a bargain. cheers.read more; i've lost 2 different pairs of in-ear tws earphones (thankfully cheaper ones) so i decided to buy

worth every penny spent. yes, i agree these headphones are highly expensive, some may say you can purchase apple airpods, boss, sennheiser, and other audio equipment options, but trust me nothing beats these bad boys.i am not a tech reviewer, but since being a musician, a music connoisseur myself and a huge fanatic of accessories such as headphones, earphones and smart gadgets, i can tell, these headphones are a revolution to the sound industry. i'll be quoting every pros and cons that i've personally come across and might help a few of you who decide to purchase this beauty.pros:1. active noise cancellation (anc): let's talk about people who love listening to their music without any external interference while working, walking, running, working out, during a flight, or any other mode where they'd use them, anc is a boon. switch to anc, you'll have the minimum of the minimum noise entering your ears. only sounds close to you can reach at a very low level, else wise, you won't feel a thing in your ear. be prepared for some bashing from your parents when they scream your name on top of their voices, and you've got that anc kicked in.2. 3 ambience sound control (asc) on: apart from the anc, there are two more features that these bad boys offer.  asc when active gives you a chance to listen to your surroundings at a certain level where you can be aware of people speaking, birds chirping, children hauling in the park, and other sounds. this feature enables one to understand the surrounding noises and doesn't feel isolated.3. ambience sound control (asc) off: when asc is disabled or switched off, you can listen to your surrounding voices in a much denser state, ie. much more clearly in comparison to when the asc is enabled. this feature is much similar to the asc on, just a slight difference of pitch and volume of the surrounding entering your ears.4. head phones connect by sony: let's talk about the main functioning unit of these headphones, the app provided by sony under the name of head phones connect. you can download it from the app store if you are an iphone user just like me, as well as from the play store for android users.this app is highly functional as well as quite intact providing a list of various functions such as adaptive sound control which is highly recommended to lazy people just like me. once all set up, the app detects your actions and locations frequently, and switches the headphones settings automatically.in addition, if you are a daily user of these headphones just like me, the app tracks your daily attributes such as at what certain volume do you like listening you music, which mode do you mostly use, which location do you travel, and then adjusts the headphones as per your choice.one feature which at first startled me a lot but i really got impressed by it which is the speak-to-chat feature. it's always annoying to either pull your phone out of your pocket and pause the music or to just pull off your headsets every time you need to talk to someone. this feature enables your headphones to pause automatically the instant you start speaking, and shall remain pause for about 20 secs and resume on their own if they do not detect any speech.for better sound quality, the app detects the size and shape of your ear through these headphones. this enables the device to perform better with distinct users.5. motion gestures: the right ear piece of the headphones has all the motion gestures such as taps for music pause/play, attend a call, play next/previous song and remove the headsets and the song pauses. these controls are highly helpful and can be easily learnt through the guide book provided, hence i won't dive deeper into it.6. number of devices that can be paired at once: these headphones provide an option of connecting two devices simultaneously. you can connect these headphones to almost every device that has a latest and updated version of bluetooth/nfc. devices that i've paired them with are iphone, macbook, hp laptop, and android phones.7. what's in the box: the box comes with an impressive in-shape carrying case to carry these bad boys where ever you go. also they include a c-type data cable for charging, 3.5mm jack cable which is quite long (haven't measured it honestly, but it is as long as a regular data cable), and a dual port 3.5mm jack converter, which so far i haven't tested.8. battery life: well i must say that i am quite impressed with the battery backup these headphones provide. this device completely charges within 3 hours and trust me with an on/off mode of playing music regularly, the battery stays up till 4-5 days, which is i bet a highly impressive feature which probably no other company audio equipment in this range might have.9. voice assist functions: these headphones can be connected to google assistant, siri and alexa and perform really well.10. easy access keys: the headphones are enable with two easy access keys on the left earphone. the custom key toggles between the 3 modes that i've already mentioned above which are guided by the in-built assistant voice. the power key pressed long enough, turns on/off the device and pressed once, the in-built assist provides you with the current % of the battery left.11. comfort: i should had talked about it earlier, but never mind. with no questions asked these headphones are highly comfortable, the cushion provided is the softest pad your ears can get. since i am regular spectacle user, i find it hard with headphones imposing excessive pressure over the ears, making it a painful experience, but these headphones give a feather touch to your ears, even if you are specy or even while wearing a face mask. these go good with everything.12. battery saver: these headphones tend to power-off on their own if not in use for more than a minute which is a highly power efficient feature added by sony to the device.cons:1. if you are into running or any sort of longer workouts, be prepared for sweaty ears. since the cushions on these headphones completely cover you ears, creating a vacuum sort of environment, no air flows in and out, and the sweat starts dripping down from the earphones, which i must state doesn't affect them at all, only can be slightly irritating sometimes.2. anc can be difficult to be kept enabled every time since it reduces the environment sounds to almost negligible, which can be dangerous while running or walking at a buss street. be very careful while using this feature. probably it is made for environments such as while travelling in a bus or a flight, and seems suitable for these environments.3. since these headphones can be simultaneously be connected to two devices at once, which is a boon, but is also a slight problem in disguise. imagine your headphones are connected with your laptop as well as you phone. you are attending an important zoom call while on your laptop and the headphones are in action, your phone starts to ring, now abruptly you'll start hearing you phones ringtone, and the device gets a little startled to which device shall be entertained. i've personally faced this, but i tend not to connect them to two devices at once.ps: one highly important thing is, you won't get an experience of the sound through reading review or watching youtube videos. you might get a fair image of weather to invest in them or not, but you'll only get the sound experience when you'll listen the music through these bad boys.read more; i have been using these industry leading headphones by sony, colour midnight blue, and trust me i find them worth every penny spent. yes, i agree these headphones are highly expensive, some may say you can purchase apple airpods, boss, sennheiser, and other audio equipment options, but trust me nothing beats these bad boys.i am not a tech reviewer, but since being a musician, a music connoisseur myself and a huge fanatic of accessories such as headphones, earphones and smart gadgets, i can tell, these headphones are a revolution to the sound industry. i'll be quoting every pros and cons that i've personally come across and might help a few of you who decide to purchase this beauty.pros:1. active noise cancellation (anc): let's talk about people who love listening to their music without any external interference while working, walking, running, working out, during a flight, or any other mode where they'd use them, anc is a boon. switch to anc, you'll have the minimum of the minimum noise entering your ears. only sounds close to you can reach at a very low level, else wise, you won't feel a thing in your ear. be prepared for some bashing from your parents when they scream your name on top of their voices, and you've got that anc kicked in.2. 3 ambience sound control (asc) on: apart from the anc, there are two more features that these bad boys offer.  asc when active gives you a chance to listen to your surroundings at a certain level where you can be aware of people speaking, birds chirping, children hauling in the park, and other sounds. this feature enables one to understand the surrounding noises and doesn't feel isolated.3. ambience sound control (asc) off: when asc is disabled or switched off, you can listen to your surrounding voices in a much denser state, ie. much more clearly in comparison to when the asc is enabled. this feature is much similar to the asc on, just a slight difference of pitch and volume of the surrounding entering your ears.4. head phones connect by sony: let's talk about the main functioning unit of these headphones, the app provided by sony under the name of head phones connect. you can download it from the app store if you are an iphone user just like me, as well as from the play store for android users.this app is highly functional as well as quite intact providing a list of various functions such as adaptive sound control which is highly recommended to lazy people just like me. once all set up, the app detects your actions and locations frequently, and switches the headphones settings automatically.in addition, if you are a daily user of these headphones just like me, the app tracks your daily attributes such as at what certain volume do you like listening you music, which mode do you mostly use, which location do you travel, and then adjusts the headphones as per your choice.one feature which at first startled me a lot but i really got impressed by it which is the speak-to-chat feature. it's always annoying to either pull your phone out of your pocket and pause the music or to just pull off your headsets every time you need to talk to someone. this feature enables your headphones to pause automatically the instant you start speaking, and shall remain pause for about 20 secs and resume on their own if they do not detect any speech.for better sound quality, the app detects the size and shape of your ear through these headphones. this enables the device to perform better with distinct users.5. motion gestures: the right ear piece of the headphones has all the motion gestures such as taps for music pause/play, attend a call, play next/previous song and remove the headsets and the song pauses. these controls are highly helpful and can be easily learnt through the guide book provided, hence i won't dive deeper into it.6. number of devices that can be paired

sound signature, anc works like a charm. multi-point feature adds convenience.; with cable they don't use any battery and of course the sony headphone app with it's equalizer doesn't work then either. i've tried them with and without a dac (ifi) and they really have a lot of well sounding to deliver to it's user - especially with hi-res lossless and atmos track. they are easily driven when connected to a computer and the sound was amazing. breathtaking. i couldn't believe what i was experiencing. finding nuances in songs i never have heard before. yes, bluetooth is great but with the cable they really come alive. at least imho. as with my xm4 in ear, the bluetooth connection works great and with sony headphones app (tried on iphone and ipad) where you can fine tune the equalizer to your liking. some said that they are bass heavy, but imho i wouldn't say that. it's there but not overtaking as some reviewers have stated. rather quite neutral. left to test is the noise cancelling when outside so i can't say anything about that yet - but i imagine it's like my in ear xm4 and those take away engine sound, people talking and so on. if you decide to get these i don't think you will be anything but pleased. and for us100 less than the xm5 it's just great. and these head phone cups folds which the xm5 don't... and i have a boose that are like that and it isn't great - aren't things supposed to get better and more innovative? what i mean is: great to not feel like being strangled when you take them off and let them rest on your neck. now i have over ear headphones that hopefully will last as long as my old ones: 20+ years... and with the flexibiity to use bluetooth as well. these are my only over ear from now on. i hope this ""review"" is of some usefulness for you. cheers!read more; with cable they don't use any battery and of course the sony headphone app with it's equalizer doesn't work then either. i've tried them with and without a dac (ifi) and they

flojera leer, de entrada te digo que esto vale cada centavo, no lo dudes ni esperes, rompe el cochinito porque te lo estás perdiendo.ahora si para los que dudan de dios:hace 3 años adquirí los mdr-xb950n1, mejor conocidos como los sony extra bass. sin duda fueron una compra demasiado buena, pasé de unos skullcandy hesh 2 a los extra bass y vaya que la diferencia es muy considerable.ahora, 3 años después decidí hacer un ""upgrade"", yo me dedico a la música, soy estudiante de la materia y me dedico al audio, la verdad es que no puedo llevarme mis audífonos de estudio fuera de casa, necesitaba unos que realmente ofrecieran buena calidad, portabilidad y facilidad de uso con mis aplicaciones. encontré estos después de hacer un par de búsquedas en internet, los comparé con varias opciones y al final me decidí por comprarlos.en primera debo decir que he quedado impresionado por la tecnología que traen estos audífonos. puedes personalizar el audio acorde a tu oreja, así es, a la forma de tu oreja, sony te pide que tomes un par de fotos para que se puedan analizar y proveer mejor experiencia, nunca en mi vida había visto algo así.desde que los abres se denota un producto bastante premium y que vale el dinero que se paga por él, ya que de hecho no es nada barato.la experiencia de abrirlo es excelente, pero es cuando bajas la aplicación que empiezas a ver lo brutal de estas máquinas. de adelanto estos audífonos ya vienen con carga máxima, o al menos así fue en mi caso, no te pide que los cargues ni nada, funcionan desde que los sacas de la caja. son extremadamente cómodos y si eres miope como yo y usas fierros para ver, estos audífonos no te van a incomodar en ningún momento.no es que quiera advertir, sino más bien dar aviso de que por defecto los audífonos se oyen un poco flojos, el sonido está un poco saturado, y si te gusta escuchar música como el heavy metal o música clásica te quedas pasmado, no se oyen para nada como los extra bass que al salir de la caja otorgan un sonido fino y bien configurado. estos no, pero entiendo por qué lo hacen, ya que como mencioné, la experiencia de verdad comienza cuando bajas la aplicación que tiene como mil opciones de configuración y optimización de sonido, así que prepárate para estar ahí unos 25 minutos de tu vida, que sin duda alguna por supuesto, lo valen.una vez que has pasado las optimizaciones, toca jugar con el ecualizador, yo recomiendo configuración 400: 1 1k: 3 2.5k: 7 6.3k: 8 16k: 5 clear bass: +5 o +7 para escuchar heavy metal y música clásica, aunque si eres fan de los medios tal vez quieras mover un poco más, pero como dije, esto es libre y sony te prevé todas las herramientas para que esto quede sabroso.ya con todo listo, toca escuchar música, y ahí es cuando te da el golpe. sabía que habría una diferencia entre los extra bass que tengo y los m4 que son estos, pero no sabía que realmente se fuera a notar tanto. estos no son audífonos, son interfaces de audio andantes, además, sony te regala una prueba gratis en cualquier servicio de restringe que contenga su servicio sony audio 3d, yo escogí tidal, pero también puedes escoger otros 3 más, ahí aparece la opción.de verdad que escuchar música en formato de alta calidad como es el flac que te ofrece tidal es algo maravilloso, inclusive después de varios años escuchando lo mismo, logré notar varios elementos musicales extras que antes ni sabía que existían en la canción, ahí es cuando te vas para atrás, es como por fin escuchar las cosas sin filtro. también recomiendo el formato ""loss-less"" de apple music en caso de que sean usuarios de iphone o solo para que tengan una tercera opción. sea cual sea el servicio que escojan, se oye increíble, pero sin duda combinado con formatos de baja compresión esto se vuelve místico.claro que esto no es tan plano como unos audífonos de estudio, pero sin duda la experiencia se acerca bastante.en conclusión, estos audífonos realmente son un producto bastante premium, te otorgan no solo alta calidad de audio, sino una experiencia tecnológica muy innovadora, además vienen con su porta audiófonos y cables correspondientes, son muy cómodos y portables. los recomiendo al 100% no duden en adquirirlo para nada.read more; review completo como consumidor y profesional dedicado al audio, si te da flojera leer, de entrada te digo que esto vale cada centavo, no lo dudes ni

"Sony WH-CH520 Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, Up to 50Hrs Battery-Beige","₹4,449",4.1,B0BZPK3XFQ,https://www.amazon.in/Sony-WH-CH520-Headphones-Multipoint-Connectivity/dp/B0BZPK3XFQ/ref=sr_1_19?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.txEjLiMOdAOFe15CvlkHgZP6MKt62XQZzhFfVKvT44_u_cTgMAjayEe_qJiM1ols70BUulsFYDO96ZGYEOtOh7wV1vlea_PFemA9CFQE-Dx_83QSXb7tPz15JP1MhUxntPPKLcByWaIItCuqZpveaymxz4C_RIZB25VmoQ_CprEBrRCFiV8yEqAKVqqo-BbyJpxO_xvBgnyTPSCwOd5LrNqhN-acKfLLtLJU5UMxWzc.tJ5wHCVcxNkwbn5Yg4K7g1huRAWD8mFobZSSDE7rMiA&dib_tag=se&keywords=headphones&qid=1747130623&sr=8-19,"so if you're considering to buy this pair of headphones or have already brought it and need a little tweak to the sound to up the excitement, give this review a read. i know it's somewhat lengthy :( but if you've already bought this pair, skip to the last part, that is, bonus.sound quality:-pretty good. as you might know, sony is sony when it comes to sound. the audio is clear and has that calm, balanced profile that i prefer to the bass oriented profiles of boat and jbl. if you are a basshead, i don't think these headphones will be your go to. but if you've been using bass heavy headphones, you will feel and instant change in audio quality and the overall beauty of music once you switch to a sony device. keep in mind that i'm not a professional audiophile or something. i love listening to quality music and watching movies and these headphones are perfect. i use apple music and the sound is bliss, idk about spotify though but i think it will fare equally well. i like bass and these headphones do provide bass, just that they are not overkill and distort the entire sound looking for it. these feel more premium in the sound department. however some people might feel a lack of excitement in their sound out of the box. worry not, i've added an eq tweak to fix your problem at the end of this review.specs:-30mm drivers. so not as loud as the 40mm ones boat and jbl offer in this price range. but i've felt (personally) the audio quality to be better. bluetooth 5.2 which is solid. multipoint connection makes sure that this will not be outdated soon. they've been released in 2023 and will remain in contention for atleast a couple of years. multipoint has to be turned on in headphones app and i use it to connect the headphones to my macbook to watch movies and to my android phone, which might be on charging or in another room, to attend calls. the switching is seamless and works well. they don't have touch controls though, so it will take a couple of tries to learn to get the buttons right, especially in a dark room. they have dsee which is basically a feature to enhance low quality/ compressed audios downloaded from internet. it has to be turned on in the app and is not needed for spotify or apple music as they are already best quality music and dsee takes up additional battery charge. battery is solid. they were 70% out of the box and after 20 hr playback still had 50% left. so i guess they'll last for atleast 50 hrs like they claim on the box. i don't like charging my devices all the time and i use them for max 5 hrs a day for which they will last close to 2 weeks which is good. no anc though, it's not a problem for me but if it is for you, don't buy. mic is good, i've attended calls in the midst of traffic and they were pretty fine.comfort:-i've tried many midrange headphones and these are some of the best in terms of comfort too. soft earcups that sit compact on my ear. however if they are not positioned properly, they might exert pressure. but on proper positioning, they will give 2 to 2.5 hours playback without any discomfort. after that you will have to take a break. i don't have big ears btw. they are lightweight and have an adjustable headband with cushion. so as far as on ear headphones are concerned, these are comfortable.build:-plastic but feels durable. not creaking. the earcups are the types which forms wrinkles, they look durable but i don't know if they will pinch unless i use it for atleast 6 months. anyway these have replacement earcups available online and in sony service centers. i have one near my house. i don't think they are sweat resistant so don't use it for workouts. for jogging they will stay in place once positioned compactly, but for running they will slip off ear.drawbacks:-lack of aux cable. once you are out of charge, that's that. it says they support fast charging on box, but i haven't tried that so idk. normally takes 2 hours atleast to charge from 20 to 100. another drawback is portability. they are not foldable and even though the plastic feels durable, i'd suggest you don't bump them much. while travelling either buy a case or carry them around in the box they come with (don't worry about looking cheap, the box doesn't have anything like specs or other bs written on it. only thing written is sony. it's inside the white cover that mentions specs).conclusion:-they offer value for money if you ask me. the sound is premium for a budget segment and not too bass oriented. the headphone app means it will get firmware updates and has some listening modes that actually work, it is not a gimmick. they look and feel premium too. and unlike anker or ath, they have service centers all over so if any issue pops up, that's an added boost too. the don't have an in box warranty card but worry not, the moment you connect your device to the headphones app they are registered. keep the amazon invoice with you, in the box or download it in pdf form from your orders section.bonus:-if the headphones lack excitement to you out of the box, the headphones app offer some preset eq. but i will share this tweak i found from reddit. they worked for me so if you don't know how to configure the eq on your own, try this;select manual on eq in sony headphones app.put 400 to 2.put 1k to 4.put 2.5k to 7.put 6.3k to 7.put 16k to 5.put clear bass to 2.try out this tweak and see if it works for you. this works on some higher end sony models too. enjoy your headphones!!!read more; so if you're considering to buy this pair of headphones or have

it for atleast 6 months. anyway these have replacement earcups available online and in sony service centers. i have one near my house. i don't think they are sweat resistant so don't use it for workouts. for jogging they will stay in place once positioned compactly, but for running they will slip off ear.drawbacks:-lack of aux cable. once you are out of charge, that's that. it says they support fast charging on box, but i haven't tried that so idk. normally takes 2 hours atleast to charge from 20 to 100. another drawback is portability. they are not foldable and even though the plastic feels durable, i'd suggest you don't bump them much. while travelling either buy a case or carry them around in the box they come with (don't worry about looking cheap, the box doesn't have anything like specs or other bs written on it. only thing written is sony. it's inside the white cover that mentions specs).conclusion:-they offer value for money if you ask me. the sound is premium for a budget segment and not too bass oriented. the headphone app means it will get firmware updates and has some listening modes that actually work, it is not a gimmick. they look and feel premium too. and unlike anker or ath, they have service centers all over so if any issue pops up, that's an added boost too. the don't have an in box warranty card but worry not, the moment you connect your device to the headphones app they are registered. keep the amazon invoice with you, in the box or download it in pdf form from your orders section.bonus:-if the headphones lack excitement to you out of the box, the headphones app offer some preset eq. but i will share this tweak i found from reddit. they worked for me so if you don't know how to configure the eq on your own, try this;select manual on eq in sony headphones app.put 400 to 2.put 1k to 4.put 2.5k to 7.put 6.3k to 7.put 16k to 5.put clear bass to 2.try out this tweak and see if it works for you. this works on some higher end sony models too. enjoy your headphones!!!read more; so if you're considering to buy this pair of headphones or have already brought it and need a little tweak to the sound to up the excitement, give this review a read. i know it's somewhat lengthy :( but if you've already bought this pair, skip to the last part, that is, bonus.sound quality:-pretty good. as you might know, sony is sony when it comes to sound. the audio is clear and has that calm, balanced profile that i prefer to the bass oriented profiles of boat and jbl. if you are a basshead, i don't think these headphones will be your go to. but if you've been using bass heavy headphones, you will feel and instant change in audio quality and the overall beauty of music once you switch to a sony device. keep in mind that i'm not a professional audiophile or something. i love listening to quality music and watching movies and these headphones are perfect. i use apple music and the sound is bliss, idk about spotify though but i think it will fare equally well. i like bass and these headphones do provide bass, just that they are not overkill and distort the entire sound looking for it. these feel more premium in the sound department. however some people might feel a lack of excitement in their sound out of the box. worry not, i've added an eq tweak to fix your problem at the end of this review.specs:-30mm drivers. so not as loud as the 40mm ones boat and jbl offer in this price range. but i've felt (personally) the audio quality to be better. bluetooth 5.2 which is solid. multipoint connection makes sure that this will not be outdated soon. they've been released in 2023 and will remain in contention for atleast a couple of years. multipoint has to be turned on in headphones app and i use it to connect the headphones to my macbook to watch movies and to my android phone, which might be on charging or in another room, to attend calls. the switching is seamless and works well. they don't have touch controls though, so it will take a couple of tries to learn to get the buttons right, especially in a dark room. they have dsee which is basically a feature to enhance low quality/ compressed audios downloaded from internet. it has to be turned on in the app and is not needed for spotify or apple music as they are already best quality music and dsee takes up additional battery charge. battery is solid. they were 70% out of the box and after 20 hr playback still had 50% left. so i guess they'll last for atleast 50 hrs like they claim on the box. i don't like charging my devices all the time and i use them for max 5 hrs a day for which they will last close to 2 weeks which is good. no anc though, it's not a problem for me but if it is for you, don't buy. mic is good, i've attended calls in the midst of traffic and they were pretty fine.comfort:-i've tried many midrange headphones and these are some of the best in terms of comfort too. soft earcups that sit compact on my ear. however if they are not positioned properly, they might exert pressure. but on proper positioning, they will give 2 to 2.5 hours playback without any discomfort. after that you will have to take a break. i don't have big ears btw. they are lightweight and have an adjustable headband with cushion. so as far as on ear headphones are concerned, these are comfortable.build:-plastic but feels durable. not

reuniones virtuales y hay días en que los traigo puestos tal vez 5 o 6 horas seguidas sin quitármelos y no me molestan, a veces hasta se me olvida que los traigo. excelente conectividad bluetooth con el celular y laptop, se pueden conectar ambos a la vez. en el gimnasio los he usado corriendo y haciendo todo tipo de ejercicios y son cómodos, ligeros y no se mueven. los he sudado y la cubierta de las almohadillas no se ha dañado nada. el audio es buenísimo, muy bien nivelado y aunque no tienen cancelación de ruido, con un volumen moderado y por las mismas almohadillas, aisla lo suficientemente bien como para que los ruidos o música del gimnasio, por ejemplo, queden muy en el fondo. nunca ha sido necesario subir al máximo el volumen. además con la app puedes ecualizar a tu gusto, también recomiendo, si usas spotify, ecualizar ahí para tener la mejor experiencia posible. la batería dura muchísimo, en 3 meses de uso usándolos en promedio 3 o 4 horas diarias y solo los he puesto a cargar 3 veces. cargan muy rápido también. el único detalle que les he encontrado es que con mi smarttv hisense, jugando playstation tiene un delay de medio segundo o 1 segundo, y con youtube cada 40 segundos o 1 minuto ""se brinca"" o ""se come"" como 1 segundo tanto del audio como del video. pero para mi no ha sido problema porque realmente solo los uso para escuchar música desde mi celular y

had thse headphones, for two months now, for the gym and i still have not charged them since the day i got them. i cannot say enough.; the product arrived well packaged.  there was a delivery delay but it was not horrendous and to be expected given that it was ordered during parime days,the headphones arrived almost fully charged,  set up was relatively easy, but you really do need to use their app to complete the set up process.  the app also allows you to change some settings and select equalizer settings that work for you.the switches have a nice feel to them.  they do have raised areas designed to help you find the correct switch by feel.  there are times however when i find that it is easier to adjust the volume using the phone or i remove the headphone to make a change.  this is a very subjective items so you may not have the same issue.  no stars were deducted for that reason.these are an on ear device.  it was not uncomfortable to me, but it did take some getting used to and here again...personal preference comes into play.  on a warm and humid day you may experience some sweating where the ear cup rides on your ear.  that may allow for some movement / shifting of the headphone depending on what you are doing.  they may thus not work out well for use doing exercising as an example.the sound quality is great at this price point.  i have bose ear buds.  the sound from this device is not bose quality and you should not expect it to be bose quality.  it is good to very good however.  the equalizer settings allow you to control all five typical equalizer settings plus a separate adjustment for th4 bass.paring was easy and fast.  the connection remains stable most of the time.  there is a selection that allows you to select either top quality sound or a more stable connection.  i chose sound quality an the vast majority of the time the connection was stable with no noise present.  there may be times however, that due to local conditions / interference you may have a little popping or very brief drop out.  i have worn these headphones a lot since they arrived and while i have experienced that, it was very limited.  now i also have a lot of electric / electronic devices in use on my property and that will may explain what i experienced.  i did have some interference from some household devices when i wass very close to them.the battery life seems to be very good.  i have worn m for several hours and the voice system still indicates 100% at startup. unlike my bose products the battery monitoring system is not linear where it will call out 100%, 90%, 80%b etc...  it may call out 100% until the battery hits 50% (as an example) and then te voice system will drop from stating 100% to 50%.  i do not see that as an issue or negative given the very long stated by the manufacturer battery life, and i have no disagreement with their claims about battery life aty this point in time,so again...thus far i am very pleased with the fit, quality, and sound quality of these headphones.  do bed aware that tey are not noise cancelling.  there will be some outside noise reduction dur to the ear cups of course.read more; the product arrived well

guys, before buying these headphones, make sure to carefully read the return/replacement terms and conditions. amazon will only take responsibility if the product is damaged upon delivery. if the product turns out to be defective or has other issues, amazon won't help—you'll have to claim the warranty through boat's service center.and before you rely on that, i suggest you check out how boat's service actually is—just search on youtube. also, watch the video i’ve shared.i bought these headphones myself and received a defective product. when i plugged in the aux cable and played games, my teammates kept hearing an irritating noise. i tested it on both ipad and android, plus six other devices—the issue was the same every time.when i contacted amazon, they said the product wasn’t damaged, so i should reach out to boat. boat picked up my product, kept it for 13 days, and then sent the same unit back saying there was no issue with it. so, i didn’t even get a replacement.read more;

i am using it continuously for last 6 months and gave it 5🌟 overall for the things it offers in the price of just 6k... yes 6k is just the initiation of good quality anc bluetooth over the ear headset, people are expecting xm or bose or sennheiser quality in 6k or 8k,lol....if it's in 8k or 10k range i would give it 4🌟 instead. here's my findings —pros:-1. sound output - 4.5/5 ... default sound is pretty flat, but quickly gets interesting after playing with eq, dsee, anc etc. . sound volume is pretty average but distortion in max vol. is low. it's a general purpose headset, good enough for all aspects like rock, pop, bass,instrumental, classical, rap etc. . seperation is nice, different tones have distinct identities. but for specific needs like for bass or vocal, strech your budget a bit more. i don't think you can get better than this balance of sound output in this budget.2. anc - 4/5 actually it's pretty decent, but could be a little better. afterall it's an entry level anc.3. built - 4.5/5 simplistic plastic built, no fancy cosmetics, but solid and mature, very much flexible, not gonna break anytime, good elasticity for sticking with head. though it's plastic built but has stainless steel housing around stretchable arms which is very nice to have for long term usage. most headsets break from this sections.4. battery- 5/5 fabulous battery life even with anc on . charging it like smartphones from 20 to 90% and getting about 1 week to 10 days of battery life with intense usage. charging takes about 50 mins for the above session.5. comfort - 4/5 nice padded ear cups, but brings sweat quickly and then feels a bit warm... but prolonged usage doesn't hurt that much as once i had used it about 2hrs at a single strech.6. connectivity- 5/5 very strong bluetooth connectivity, works seamlessly even with 10 meters of distance with walls and different floors.but still not that useful for online gaming via wireless mode as it has a little bit of latency.cons. :-1. crap when connected to pc via wire and headset turned off.2. like other over the ear, gets uncomfortable in scorching summer and humid conditions.3. lack of ldac , hence no hi-res audio, but in this price bracket it's ok.4. though doesn't feel cheap, but some aesthetics should be there.verdict:- you can absolutely go with it if you are getting it around 6000/- for no specific taste. don't expect it to outperform those ult or xms, it's illogical to think. if you want the ultimate one then there are xm, momentum, quitecomfort or those beyerdynamics....instead of going with intermediates, either go with this one or go with those super expensive ones. and those people comparing it with much lower priced headphones and saying it worse, they simply don't have the sensitivity to differentiate between subtle frequencies, and those subtle frequencies make it sweet.'made for iphone/ipod' written on the outside of the box, which is strange, probably will work better with ios than android. i'm an android user (pixel) though:).at last, it's a sweet headphone.those images are after 6 months of usage!!read more;

i am beyond disappointed with my recent purchase of wireless bluetooth headphones from amazon. from the moment i received the product, it has been nothing but a headache. the headphones are completely defective – the bluetooth feature does not work at all. i tried connecting them to multiple phones, including different brands and models, but the headphones simply refuse to pair. it’s clear that the product is faulty, and no amount of troubleshooting has made a difference.when i reached out to the seller for assistance, their response was utterly unhelpful. they provided no useful solutions or support, and it felt like they were just brushing me off. i then tried to initiate a return and refund through amazon, only to find out that it’s not possible. how is this even acceptable? i paid for a product that doesn’t function as advertised, and now i’m stuck with it. it’s incredibly frustrating to feel like i’ve been scammed out of my money.to make matters worse, amazon’s customer service was no help either. they were unable to resolve the issue and offered no real solution. it’s shocking that a platform as large as amazon would allow such poor-quality products to be sold and then fail to support customers when things go wrong. the entire experience has left me feeling cheated and helpless.this purchase has been a total waste of time and money. the headphones are useless, the seller is unresponsive, and amazon’s customer service is ineffective. i regret ever buying this product and will definitely think twice before making another purchase on amazon. the lack of accountability from both the seller and amazon is unacceptable.i would strongly advise others to avoid this seller and be cautious when shopping on amazon. there’s no guarantee that you’ll receive a functional product, and if something goes wrong, you might be left with no recourse. save yourself the frustration and shop elsewhere. this experience has been a complete disaster, and i will never recommend this seller or rely on amazon for a resolution again.read more;

media could not be loaded.before receiving the product, these were my concerns:-1. alot of reviews were bout how the mic is bad , hence i was concerned.2. worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. cuz i needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.3.comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .4.sturdiness and build quality.5.looks obviously , pictures were good but i didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. not a single concern was founded to be true.1.mic is working absolutely fine. you can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. if you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). for all other purposes its perfect.2.i received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am i switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. it has been playing non stop. its perfect. if you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. you don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). battery life is sufficient. i haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. anyway , by what i've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. very comfortable. its definitely over the ears and completely covers them. even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. also , i dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , i've seen heavier gaming headphones. don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .4.build quality is very nice , sturdy and strong. the speakers are tightly held with the band and while i don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. it loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . the rgb looks so beautiful and catchy. the overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. everything is perfect. though i wish now that i should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... it would've looked cooler with rgb.6. with bluetooth , its justt awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ i like it (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). i don't play games so i can't talk bout latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. now talking bout the wired mode. it might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. the clarity is just perfect and no latency ofcourse. no need of battery in aux mode. can keep using it even if the battery is dead. i like this feature so much. for a student like me , its a charmer. no unnecessary breaks . and with the full sound ☠️ you won't hear even if someone's getting murderrred in the next room ☠️ its that awesome.  sound does leak , but its tooo loud as well. i mean , its like a freakin mini speaker on medium volume when you keep it aside and max the volume. it is crazyyyy . you can just hang it on your neck if it gets too hot n you'll still hear everything.it is honestly my very first wireless headphones. but i have used boat rockerz which my friend has , and i can say without a doubt , giving 200 more for this one is definitely worth it.the comfort , the looks , the loudness , the rgb (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). i even got 129 cashback so it had to be a steal deal for me 😁.i'm so glad i bought this as my first headphones. i was very skeptical but now that i'm using it 😍 , its just a wonderful experience.most negative comments i believe are one in hundred instances or anomaly or exceptions. most people don't review a product till it's defective. only very few people review when the product it perfect.this is to help first timers like me or for anyone who want a good headphone.don't worry bout anything , just go for it. luck can be bad sometimes nd you might get a bad piece , just get it replaced nd voila , problems solved. its not like 100% of manufactured products are bad ☠️. anyway. ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.read more; the media could not be loaded.before receiving the product, these were my concerns:-1. alot of reviews were bout how the mic is bad , hence i was concerned.2. worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. cuz i needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.3.comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .4.sturdiness and build quality.5.looks obviously , pictures were good but i didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. not a single concern was founded to be true.1.mic is working absolutely fine. you can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. if you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). for all other purposes its perfect.2.i received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am i switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. it has been playing non stop. its perfect. if you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. you don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). battery life is sufficient. i haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. anyway , by what i've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. very comfortable. its definitely over the ears and completely covers them. even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. also , i dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , i've seen heavier gaming headphones. don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .4.build quality is very nice , sturdy and strong. the speakers are tightly held with the band and while i don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. it loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . the rgb looks so beautiful and catchy. the overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. everything is perfect. though i wish now that i should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... it would've looked cooler with rgb.6. with bluetooth , its justt awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ i like it (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). i don't play games so i can't talk bout latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. now talking bout the wired mode. it might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. the clarity is just perfect and no latency ofcourse. no need of battery in aux mode. can keep using it even if the battery is dead. i like this feature so much. for a student like me , its a charmer. no unnecessary breaks . and with

put straight for 2 to 3 hours, after it might feel a bit discomfort, depends on person to person. great battery, brand claims 40hr and i get too around 38 to 39hr in it which says its approved for long hours. very good sound quality, if you are confused between two headphones in this budget and you like bass more, then pick this one it has great bass. so everything is good, but there is one major, very big problem which is kinda aceeptable for someone and not for a lot of pepole. the problem is sound leakage, if you listen even above 50% vol or for some songs even at 30% vol, the sound starts to get outside earphone. your experience won't get bad for urself but the outsiders could also hear it which is why its not good to use it in public. if u go on 90% volume, rather than a headphone it becomes a speaker, u won't face any problem in ears, but voice outside will come loud easily hearable. it means brand gave everything, but could not block the speakers towards the outer end meaning voice gets outside easilyread more; great budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together. great build

levels, sometimes distorts a little at high specificly there's a monster mode at that.this is my first over the ear headphone even though the design is comfortable sounds good, i feel separated earphones are more comfortable for long use where as over the ear kind compresses the skull.; 3.5/5i have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. i got it for a nice deal (approx. rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). i was reviewing multiple headphones under the rs. 5k range. my first choice was the sony ch-520, but i did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and i didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under rs. 5k). the other options were boat, zebronics (a different set), hammer and a variety of other ones.among them i did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. i wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. it was available at a reasonable price and the rgb lights impressed me. so i ordered them.pros:- sounds good! i'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. no issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. the bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- sturdy. the headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. while laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. i have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. they are still in good shape- rgb. the lights are definitely funky. they look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- battery. applaudable battery without hesitation. i use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.cons:- mic. i've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. my peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what i just said- huge cushions and ear muffs! the size of the muffs are simply too big. when traveling with the headphones on in buses, i like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. but this is simply not possibly with these headphones. the muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. when i try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. so i'm forced to sit rigid for a while- terrible button placement. the power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. this makes it very hard to use the controls. i have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. it's so ridiculous that i stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- bad usb-c connection slot. the usb-c connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other usb-c wires because it has a narrow deep opening. so my phone's usb-c charger doesn't fit in it. only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. this means i always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackoverall decent pair. in my previous (edited now) review, i mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. after several days i realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. so, i have edited my review and updated the ratingcheers!read more; 3.5/5i have been using these headphones for over 2 months

i have been using these headphones for a week now with daily usage of about 10hrs and one thing that i can confidently say is that i did not feel any sort of discomfort or pain in the surrounding areas of the ears even after long hours of gaming, that's great. the sound itself is good for a headphone at this price, slightly on the basy side, however the 7.1 surround which they provide with these headphones i found them a gimmick imho, like i didn't find much difference with it being on or off, tested in competitive games like pubg, valo and cs. footsteps, gunshots and directional sounds were clear and accurate even with the 7.1 surround off. one reason that i might feel such way is that i use nahimic as my primary sound software and eq. and i have surround enabled in there.as for music, the sound quality is good enough.the only thing which i don't like about this headphone is its cable. firstly its thin and short, though you get the splitter cable along with it which can increase the overall length but who wants to use a splitter?! especially when the splitter itself is even thinner.read more;

it's also about it being on time, and these earphones deliver that pretty well.comfort & passive noise isolation:comfort is key when it comes to neckbands, and the z2 doesn’t disappoint. they come with multiple earbud sizes, so you can pick the one that fits snugly for you. while there’s no active noise cancellation (anc) here, you can achieve a decent level of passive noise isolation by choosing the right ear tips. this makes a noticeable difference in cutting out background noise during commutes or at the office.app experience & annoying blinking light:now, onto a couple of quirks. the bullets z2 uses the heymelody app, which offers additional features like custom sound settings. however, my unit just wouldn’t connect with the app, which was a bummer. so, any fancy tweaks you could make through the app were out of my reach, and i had to rely solely on the default bluetooth pairing. while everything worked smoothly once connected, i feel like i missed out on some customization options that might have enhanced my experience.another thing that bugged me was the small white light that blinks when the neckband is connected to a device. it might not seem like a big deal, but if you’re using the earphones in a dark room or while lying down, that blinking light can be pretty distracting. plus, it probably drains the battery a bit, albeit a small amount. a simple option to turn this off in the app would’ve been a nice touch.final thoughts - a solid pick for most, with room for improvement:overall, the oneplus z2 delivers where it matters—good sound quality, reliable connectivity, and battery life that won’t have you constantly reaching for the charger. it’s not perfect, especially with the blinking light and app connectivity issues, but those are minor compared to the solid performance it offers. plus, with the quick-charge feature and low-latency gaming experience, it’s hard not to appreciate the value you get.if you’re looking for a reliable neckband that blends style, comfort, and balanced audio, the oneplus bullets z2 is definitely worth considering. it might not satisfy those who crave earth-shattering bass, but for most listeners, it's a worthy contender at its price point.read more;

there is nothing wrong with the looks of the bullets z2, they are actually quite decent looking. they are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. the middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, u shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. the wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. one of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the usb type c port on the side. you get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. the battery unit has the oneplus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.the earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. when the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. the bullets wireless z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. the material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. it also comes with an ip55 rating.pairing the oneplus bullets wireless z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. all you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. you can then look up the buds in the list of bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. once connected, the bullets z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.you get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, oneplus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), oneplus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. you have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. it may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.the oneplus bullets wireless z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of oneplus earphones- 12.4mm. the fact that oneplus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. the earbuds support two audio codecs, sbc and aac.as for the audio performance, the bullets wireless z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. while this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.if you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the bullets wireless z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.that said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the oneplus bullets wireless z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.the oneplus bullets wireless z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. we could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. as the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.they come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. but because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.the bullets wireless z2 also face some heat from the likes of oppo enco m32 and the realme buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. the oneplus bullets wireless z2 are actually a great proposition for the price;

this is one of the best purchases i have made in recent times. the headphones are simply awesome bang for the buck. i purchased them from 3200 from amazon and got the delivery in 2 days since the 2 day shipping was available. this review is being posted after about 2 weeks of usage.dividing the review into pros and cons -pros1. excellent soundstage.2. brilliant clarity. each instrument can be heard clearly and you will hear sounds that you never heard before.3. build quality is sturdy and premium materials have been used. considering that m20x are the starting range of the audio technica headphone, i have to say they have done a really good job. premium materials have been used, the foam at the top of the band and around the ear cups is of really good quality.cons1. the wire is really long and while this can be a pro as well since it gives the ability to move around i would have like a shorter wire and preferably a detachable wire as is provided with the 40x and other models higher up in the range2. they are big ! not something that will be very easy to carry around and i rely on by earphones for taking along in my laptop bag. these are meant to be enjoyed at home for me. when worn properly your entire ears will fit in the ear cups. and this provided excellent sound quality and noise isolation. however, the size will need getting used to and now after 2 weeks i do not feel that awkward and am able to enjoy them despite the huge size.3. your ears will sweat since they are in the ear cups and while they cannot be worn for long intervals - that is more than 30 minutes at the start. once you get used to them - after about 2 weeks and when sitting in an ac room you can easily listen to them for hours. the sound quality is so good that once you are accustomed to the size you enjoy them immensely.at the end i would like to say that these are something that every music lover should have ! yes, the sound quality is so good ! i listened to all sorts of music on these and i have to say that when used with an equalizer they are especially good. i personally use an app called ""power amp"" on android, which works great. than i also listen to a lot of wynk and you tube for which an app called ""bass equalizer"" does a really good job. this app will work with online music, that is the beauty of it.the headphones have a lot of bass, their inbuilt signature is flat and for bass lovers, when used with the apps i mentioned they give sufficient bass. the music that excels the most on these headphones is live music, like mtv unplugged. and acoustic music where guitars and cellos are used.in a nutshell, if you primarily listen to music on earphones since they are so much more convenient and easy to carry than these will be a revelation for you.read more;

5 ⭐ for sound quality 4⭐ because of the comfort.writing after 6 months of usage. this is an absolute best purchase you can have on a budget(i know what you think..though i said budget but i had to save up for three months to buy this for 4.5k inr. but compared to other studio monitor headphones and the sound quality youre getting for this price is just undeniable). i sincerely disagree with every single comments out there saying this doesn't have bass. if you're an avid listener and who listen to a lot of flac then you'll understand once you listen to this. so go for it.even though they said it's flat sound but i could already feel decent amount of bass without changing any eq settings. if you want true flat sound i would say sennheiser is the choice. i have used sennheiser and sony and this would come in the middle of both when it comes to bass but the sound quality is crisp af and top notch. and yes it does work great for movies too...i haven't played games much with this apart from one or two times.. and the wire is indeed quite long as mentioned in many other reviews...it can be a plus or minus depending on your purpose..for me it's okay as i sometimes use it with full length at home and i barely took it outside. but you can coil it up and use some velcro tape which i do sometimes..initially i felt it little bit tighter which is common for every headphones and as i have a big head but that was changed as i got used to it and it loosen up little bit and now fits perfectly without any discomfort which i experienced in the first two months.the only two drawbacks for me so far is that..one is the cushions tends to get your ears sweaty if you live in hot n humid place like mine. but inside an air conditioned room that wouldn't be much of an issue. second thing is the small wire that goes between the headband and speakers on both side...that i felt like a poor design choice and gives me anxiety manytimes that if i'll break it somehow.read more;

i purchased boat rockerz 255 z plus. i got the order today and the package is good without any damage. but the issue is with the earphones. the left earbud is producing static noise and the sound is low compared to right side. it's not like it started after a few days or months. it started on same day as i received the order and just a few minutes after i started using. i don't know if everyone is facing this issue (saw similar comments on youtube and reviews) but this is causing very bad hearing experience. i assume it may be due to driver issue or wiring in left side. request to please take note of this feedback for both buyers and the boat companyread more;

hey there, i've been using these headphones regularly for the past 6 months now, and so lemme tell you about everything which i've discovered till now...so first of all, this is probably not the best choice for bass lovers, this won't provide you with any head shaking bass, but bass is punchy and kicks in right when it has to...the connectivity is great, but can trouble you sometimes if you use them wirelessly for meetings, the sound quality is pretty awesome, deep clarity about the notes, perfect lows and highs, just lacks a bit in the mids, but you won't even notice that...gives you one of the best listening experience in all types of genres...the anc is one of the things i didn't like about it, when you turn on the anc, a very little amount of sound,mostly like fans is blocked from outside, and the bass gets affected too when anc is on, but as soon as you put these headphones on, it already blocks most of the outside noise, and when you play music with anc off, you still won't be able to hear a thing from outside which is a rare thing...the best part about this is indeed the battery life, obviously lasts upto 25-30 hours, and gets charged to around 75% in just 15 mins, impressive!talking about the comfort, they are lightweight, have perfect clamping force, and have pretty soft earpads which cover all your ear and seals it, and so there is no soundleak as well...you can also change the sound according to oyu using their app...finally putting everything together, value for the money if you listen to different genres and ofc if you are a music lover...satisfied with the purchase and performance tho...trust me sennheiser won't upset you :)read more;

this is my genuine review. these days we are overwhelmed with so many brands and earphones and it's difficult to find the best value for money deal. now i am not saying these are best but on comfort level it's excellent. you cannnot expect to get very thumping bass but they produce decent punchy bass even after being an over ear type earbuds. voice clarity is pretty good. the treble and instruments seperation is also good but not too good which is justified given the price of this product. you can work, listen music, play games and wear at the gym and you never have to worry losing it from ears. next best thing is the app controls and the customisation options in the app which is very neat and easy to do. best part and the most distinguished feature of this buds is the lights. oh man those are great attractive and you can control the colours and time and mode all in the app. so for sure i bet you that you will be very satisfied with the purchase. this is because i have also purchased both medium brands like beat, mivi, realme and high end brands like sony, samsung and most of them are either lying around unused or i returned them. you may not the anc feature here as obviously because it's open ear type earbuds. but that's how it is. it can never have an anc. but rest assured you will experience quality sound and you can express it in style with the lights enabled if you need. that's it. one last thing. if listening to music use spotify app for best experience.read more;

the headphones arrived today, and i must say, the out-of-the-box audio quality is impressive. they cater perfectly to all types of listeners, whether you're into deep bass or prefer a more balanced sound. when you activate noise cancellation, the bass becomes more subtle, ideal for those who want clarity and detail. switch to transparency mode, and the bass gets a nice boost, adding warmth to the music without overpowering. and if you're a fan of bass-heavy tunes, the bass boost mode will blow you away—it’s powerful and immersive. these headphones strike a perfect balance, making them worth every penny. whether it's crisp highs, rich mids, or booming lows, they won't disappoint.read more;

acquistate come regalo (consegna amazon come sempre perfettamente puntuale nonostante l’elevato volume di spedizioni del periodo festivo) e sono state molto apprezzate.il design è molto curato e di questo ne beneficia non solo l’estetica ma anche la comodità: al di là dell’eleganza complessiva che risalta subito, all’utilizzo si nota come l’archetto sia molto morbido e i padiglioni abbastanza spaziosi da accogliere l’orecchio senza comunque eccedere nelle dimensioni, non risultando ingombranti.la qualità del suono è adatta alla fascia di prezzo che occupa il prodotto, restando su un buon livello complessivo nonostante non riesca ovviamente a raggiungere la spaziosità del suono offerta da prodotti decisamente più high-end o cuffie aperte, che restituiscono una separazione dei toni sicuramente più accurata incrementando il livello di dettaglio percepibile. ciononostante è piacevole la possibilità di utilizzare l’app dedicata per apportare modifiche all’equalizzazione, personalizzando quindi l’esperienza d’ascolto secondo le proprie preferenze.la connettività è duplice, sia wireless che cablata, permettendo un rapido e semplice pairing bluetooth per l’utilizzo con dispositivi mobile senza rinunciare -attraverso un cavo con jack 3.5mm presente nella dotazione- alla possibilità di collegare l’headset in wired, ampliando le possibilità di impiego (per esempio, questo consente di connettere le cuffie al controller delle console ps5 ed xbox series x/s che non supportano la connessione bluetooth).la cancellazione attiva del rumore fa abbastanza bene il suo dovere, riducendo in maniera sufficientemente efficace i rumori ambientali (anche se non sempre riesce ad annichilirli completamente), ed è presente anche una modalità trasparenza che sebbene non possa competere, per esempio, con quella offerta dalle soluzioni apple (né è in dovere di farlo, vista la fascia di prezzo in cui si posiziona), permette di ascoltare l’ambiente esterno e consente la comunicazione verbale con un interlocutore. molto apprezzata la possibilità di switch dalla modalità active noise cancellation a quella trasparenza in tempo reale, possibile sia coprendo uno dei due padiglioni con la mano, sia -attualmente in versione beta attivabile tramite app- attraverso il riconoscimento autonomo della conversazione, con le cuffie che, non appena l’utente che le indossa inizia a parlare, riducono sensibilmente il volume del contenuto in riproduzione e lo ripristinano automaticamente a conversazione conclusa.read more;

i'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment i experienced with the noise two wirless. these headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.let's start with the build quality. imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. they weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.now, i'm a reasonable person. accidents happen. so, i contacted noise support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. what i got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. they dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).so, here i am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. the audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. my advice? steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.for those seeking a more constructive alternative:do your research! read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.prioritize build quality. look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.understand the warranty terms thoroughly. don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.read more;

major, very big problem which is kinda aceeptable for someone and not for a lot of pepole. the problem is sound leakage, if you listen even above 50% vol or for some songs even at 30% vol, the sound starts to get outside earphone. your experience won't get bad for urself but the outsiders could also hear it which is why its not good to use it in public. if u go on 90% volume, rather than a

earphones are more comfortable for long use where as over the ear kind compresses the skull.; 3.5/5i have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. i got it for a nice deal (approx. rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). i was reviewing multiple headphones under the rs. 5k range. my first choice was the sony ch-520, but i did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and i didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under rs. 5k). the other options were boat, zebronics (a different set), hammer and a variety of other ones.among them i did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. i wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. it was available at a reasonable price and the rgb lights impressed me. so i ordered them.pros:- sounds good! i'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. no issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. the bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- sturdy. the headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. while laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. i have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. they are still in good shape- rgb. the lights are definitely funky. they look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- battery. applaudable battery without hesitation. i use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.cons:- mic. i've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. my peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what i just said- huge cushions and ear muffs! the size of the muffs are simply too big. when traveling with the headphones on in buses, i like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. but this is simply not possibly with these headphones. the muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. when i try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. so i'm forced to sit rigid for a while- terrible button placement. the power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. this makes it very hard to use the controls. i have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. it's so ridiculous that i stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- bad usb-c connection slot. the usb-c connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other usb-c wires because it has a narrow deep opening. so my phone's usb-c charger doesn't fit in it. only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. this means i always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackoverall decent pair. in my previous (edited now) review, i mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. after several days i realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. so, i have edited my review and updated the ratingcheers!read more; 3.5/5i have been using these headphones for over 2 months

i am beyond disappointed with my recent purchase of wireless bluetooth headphones from amazon. from the moment i received the product, it has been nothing but a headache. the headphones are completely defective – the bluetooth feature does not work at all. i tried connecting them to multiple phones, including different brands and models, but the headphones simply refuse to pair. it’s clear that the product is faulty, and no amount of troubleshooting has made a difference.when i reached out to the seller for assistance, their response was utterly unhelpful. they provided no useful solutions or support, and it felt like they were just brushing me off. i then tried to initiate a return and refund through amazon, only to find out that it’s not possible. how is this even acceptable? i paid for a product that doesn’t function as advertised, and now i’m stuck with it. it’s incredibly frustrating to feel like i’ve been scammed out of my money.to make matters worse, amazon’s customer service was no help either. they were unable to resolve the issue and offered no real solution. it’s shocking that a platform as large as amazon would allow such poor-quality products to be sold and then fail to support customers when things go wrong. the entire experience has left me feeling cheated and helpless.this purchase has been a total waste of time and money. the headphones are useless, the seller is unresponsive, and amazon’s customer service is ineffective. i regret ever buying this product and will definitely think twice before making another purchase on amazon. the lack of accountability from both the seller and amazon is unacceptable.i would strongly advise others to avoid this seller and be cautious when shopping on amazon. there’s no guarantee that you’ll receive a functional product, and if something goes wrong, you might be left with no recourse. save yourself the frustration and shop elsewhere. this experience has been a complete disaster, and i will never recommend this seller or rely on amazon for a resolution again.read more;

i like the sound quality of the product , it’s volume control is good and they are really light and easy to carry around; like with most kids headphones, the sound is regulated but it's so regulated my daughter could barely hear over general noise in the room.  so for this i gave it 2 stars for noise cancellation and 4 for volume control...i think they could've gone up a tiny bit more for the volume.  the sound quality itself, other than being too low which dropped it down a star, wasn't bad.  however, after 3 months, it's crackling.  so 3 stars for that.  my daughter is a little hard on headphones...we usually have to buy the $5 ones from five below because we know in 3-6 months we'll be replacing them.  i was hoping to find these to be more durable, but the cord where the ac jack goes in is weak, which is what ended up causing the crackling issue.  if you get some sugru when you get these and immediately apply it to the ac jack's cord area to prevent a lot of bending, you might avoid this issue, and then these would be good for a toddler (since they're so quiet) or preschooler.read more;

your mouth. if you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). for all other purposes its perfect.2.i received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am i switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. it has been playing non stop. its perfect. if you switch off the lights

put straight for 2 to 3 hours, after it might feel a bit discomfort, depends on person to person. great battery, brand claims 40hr and i get too around 38 to 39hr in it which says its approved for long hours. very good sound quality, if you are confused between two headphones in this budget and you like bass more, then pick this one it has great bass. so everything is good, but there is one major, very big problem which is kinda aceeptable for someone and not for a lot of pepole. the problem is sound leakage, if you listen even above 50% vol or for some songs even at 30% vol, the sound starts to get outside earphone. your experience won't get bad for urself but the outsiders could also hear it which is why its not good to use it in public. if u go on 90% volume, rather than a headphone it becomes a speaker, u won't face any problem in ears, but voice outside will come loud easily hearable. it means brand gave everything, but could not block the speakers towards the outer end meaning voice gets outside easilyread more; great budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together. great build

earphones are more comfortable for long use where as over the ear kind compresses the skull.; 3.5/5i have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. i got it for a nice deal (approx. rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). i was reviewing multiple headphones under the rs. 5k range. my first choice was the sony ch-520, but i did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and i didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under rs. 5k). the other options were boat, zebronics (a different set), hammer and a variety of other ones.among them i did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. i wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. it was available at a reasonable price and the rgb lights impressed me. so i ordered them.pros:- sounds good! i'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. no issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. the bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- sturdy. the headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. while laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. i have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. they are still in good shape- rgb. the lights are definitely funky. they look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- battery. applaudable battery without hesitation. i use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.cons:- mic. i've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. my peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what i just said- huge cushions and ear muffs! the size of the muffs are simply too big. when traveling with the headphones on in buses, i like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. but this is simply not possibly with these headphones. the muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. when i try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. so i'm forced to sit rigid for a while- terrible button placement. the power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. this makes it very hard to use the controls. i have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. it's so ridiculous that i stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- bad usb-c connection slot. the usb-c connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other usb-c wires because it has a narrow deep opening. so my phone's usb-c charger doesn't fit in it. only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. this means i always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackoverall decent pair. in my previous (edited now) review, i mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. after several days i realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. so, i have edited my review and updated the ratingcheers!read more; 3.5/5i have been using these headphones for over 2 months

caused ear pain. after several days i realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. so, i have edited my review and updated the ratingcheers!; وصلتني الكرتون مفتوح وقماش

just after unboxing, i tested the headphone. on wireless mode, i didn't find the sound quality to be as great as i expected it to be. the noice cancellation was also not exceptional. the main problem was that when i plugged in the audio cable, i found out that the right earcup of the headphone was not working at all. it was because of loose-connection (inside headphones) somewhere i guess. i decided to give it some time before i tested it once again. this time, the wireless mode sound quality dropped significantly (on sharp beats, it started producing cracking sounds). this time on wired mode, both the earcups worked fine and the sound quality was really good. after 2-3 days of usage, cracking sound is still there on wireless mode. overall i am not satisfied with these headphones. i would recommend not investing such an amount in jbl headphones but rather to go for budget earphones. i don't think jbl puts their best efforts in this price range. if you really want high quality, go for a high-price flagship model.read more;

the neckband offers a mix of pros and cons that you should consider before purchasing.pros1. design:the neckband boasts a sporty design, making it ideal for activities like gym workouts, cycling, or jogging. it’s more suited for an active lifestyle rather than a formal or classy look.2. connectivity:while it lacks the ability to connect to two devices simultaneously and only supports bluetooth 5.0 (instead of newer versions), it still excels in quickly pairing with the connected device. this makes it reliable enough to count as a positive.3. music quality:considering its budget-friendly price, the music quality is decent. it offers a satisfactory listening experience for casual use.4. durability and build quality:although i’ve only had it for a week, the build quality seems superior compared to the low-grade products commonly found in the same price range. while it doesn’t have a premium look, it feels sturdier than typical budget options. i'll provide an update on its long-term durability later.cons1. battery life:the battery life falls short of the company's claims, lasting only 3–4 hours. this isn’t uncommon for budget-friendly neckbands, as lightweight, high-quality batteries are typically reserved for premium models. however, the false advertising by the company is disappointing.2. button placement:the volume and power buttons are placed too close to each other, making it difficult to differentiate between them. this may lead to accidental call disconnections while adjusting the volume. although it’s not a major issue, it can be inconvenient.read more;

ok, so i have been using these for the past 3 days and i was using my airpods pro before that for gaming and everything else so i will be comparing these headphones to that i know the price difference but you also need to understand that the jbl has bigger drivers and is over the ear so i think it's fair. so my initial question was do these sound as good as my airpods? i started with the song i always listen to when i get a new pair of headphones, hotel california by eagles, and these headphones well they sounded too sharp almost pain full like those cheap 100 rs earphones.so, i saw some reviews and there was a split some saying they are pretty good and others saying they are not good for music and so on. i ended up replacing my first pair of jbl. the point being if they sound like crap start by replacing them because no headphone should sound that sharp especially not with a branded pair they probably have a qc issue.  my second pair of these jbl's arrived the next, they sounded like the graph that is shown on the box pulled up high-end, mids, and bass basically increasing the overall volume of the headphone sounds bad right well not really.it's not for music i mean you can listen to it it's not bad but it's not very good either, it depends on what you listen to for example if you listen to bollywood trash (no offense i listen to them from time to time) then these headphones are not it but if you listen to older songs from classic bands (pink floyd, guns and roses, etc) or for that matter classic indian sangeet those extra high-end notes really make these headphone sing. movies are amazing, remember the extra mids and bass from the graphs well they do an amazing job of recreating the voices and the atmosphere the extra highs can be a problem if the actor has a higher-pitched voice and gets irritating so pick your poison.gaming, these are gaming headphones after all. i play games on my xbox, i bought them for my xbox and i have not a single bad thing to say about these even my first defective pair blew my head. witcher 3 (yes, i still play that game) the atmosphere the headphones create is truly amazing there were times i turned back to see if there was actually someone, it blows my airpods away, you could hear the tree trunk crack leaves fly the wind it's truly something to experience. next is forza and my opinion stays the same, same with ac odyssey as well as pupg. the mic is also very good too video calls or phone calls should not be an issue at all i mean if you are planning to buy rebranded chinese crap from the likes of cosmic bite or red dragon or gear then stop and buy this instead. but if you are planning to buy the more expensive hyper x cloud series then buy that only this is not for you.finally, let's talk about fit and finish as it will determine the isolation and comfort of any headphones. for me these headphones fit perfectly, they clamp down with just enough pressure so as to not hurt my head but are strong enough to prevent them from falling off. the fit almost reminds me of bose qc 25 headphones. this means the isolation is pretty awesome they are no active noise canceling of course but is more inline with passive noise isolating earphone so basically all the earphone on the market. the drives are placed at some distance from your ear this does two things. one, your ears don't rest on the driver like in most of these cheap chinese crap second it helps with spatial audio. the finish, on the other hand, well its cheap plastic and there is no two ways about it you touch the headphone you will know what i am talking about, it won't break but its no bose or apple in this regard, you get what you pay for the cable is braided and tangle-free though. the cushion is pretty good, it not the softest memory foam or the thickest but again it gets the job done it's covered with fake leather and is nonreplaceable so when they wear out you need to buy a brand new pair of headphones.conclusion, buy them if you are on a budget i don't think there is a better pair at this price that has the audio quality this has in games. if you have no budget and want a headphone that does everything then my airpods pro is the winners but i would recommend the hyper x cloud series for gaming if you have the budget for it at 7k.  or if you want something to go along with your xbox and don't want to spend too much like me then i would say buy these you will be happy.read more;

i've had these earphones for two years now and i couldn't be more happy with them. they were a reluctant replacement for my existing pair back then which had broken down. i never believed that these would be anywhere near par with those but boy, was i wrong.i always go for wired earphones because of my own reasons. the main of which are the sound quality and the overall performance of the earphones across the entire spectrum of sound. to buy a pair with a similar performance as these in bluetooth earphones you could easily have to shell out as much as ten thousand bucks. the main antagonist of wired earphones which is entanglement of the wires never bothers me much so i usually don't have much of a problem.to compare it with the other earphones in the wired category of the same range, these are hands down miles ahead of any competitor. they may be a hundred odd bucks expensive from its competitors but the overall value derived from these far outweighs that amount. the manufacturers now a days very shrewdly give features in their earphones which allow them to play bass very well which gives an impression that they are indeed fabulous on an ordinary hearing. but if you continue to test them on different parameters of sound performance you soon realize that its a deliberate marketing ploy deployed by the manufacturers to fool you into believing that their earphones are far superior than their price tag. these kinds of earphones usually fall flat on every other parameter. their performance at high volumes become undesirable and sound phony to the ear. the noise is shrill at higher notes and the sound never is tempered across the entire frequency range except maybe when the bass kicks in. however, you won't find any such jarring problems in these earphones. sony has been in the music business for long and they know how to provide quality to their customers and know that their customers demand quality from them. they don't disappoint with this product. i may be wrong but i can go out on a limb and say that these are probably the best earphones you may find till the fifteen hundred price range. the other, mainly chinese, competitors are out to hoodwink their customers into buying their products by tempting price tags and superficially apparent features but you can easily give them a pass in favour of this pair.tl,dr - these might be the best earphones in this price range and even amongst ones in a level higher range. don't fret and buy this product assuredly.read more;

i’ve been using the blaupunkt bh41 for about two months now, and they’ve proven to be a solid choice for casual listening. at this price point, they offer a balanced mix of sound quality, build, and features, though they’re not without a few compromises. here’s a quick breakdown of my experience.---pros:✅ nice sound quality:the bh41 delivers a pleasant sound signature with decent bass, clear mids, and crisp treble. it works well across most music genres and is also good for podcasts and videos. while it doesn’t cater to audiophiles, for casual use, it’s more than enough.✅ solid build quality:the build feels sturdy and durable, giving the headphones a premium touch. i’ve used them daily, and they’ve held up well without any noticeable wear or creaking.✅ lightweight & comfortable fit:these headphones are super lightweight, making them comfortable for long listening sessions. the clamping force is just right, and i didn’t experience any fatigue, even after hours of use.✅ aux port for wired mode:one of the best features is the inclusion of an aux port, allowing you to switch to a wired connection when the battery is low. it’s a lifesaver during long trips.✅ impressive battery life:battery life is surprisingly good. i’ve consistently gotten around 25-30 hours of playback on a single charge, making them perfect for extended use without worrying about recharging.---cons:❗ bluetooth version & latency:the bh41 uses an older bluetooth version, which results in a slight delay when watching videos or gaming. it’s not a dealbreaker, but noticeable latency can be annoying if you’re sensitive to sync issues.❗ small ear cups – almost on-ear feel:although marketed as over-ear headphones, the ear cups are quite small. if you have larger ears, they may feel more like on-ears. luckily, my ears are on the smaller side, so i got a snug fit, but this might not be the case for everyone.❗ no aux cable included:while the aux port is a great addition, it’s disappointing that no aux cable is included in the box. if you want to use them wired, you’ll need to buy a separate cable.❗ no app support (but not a major issue):there’s no companion app for eq adjustments or firmware updates. while this isn’t a big issue considering the price, having app support would’ve been a nice bonus.---verdict:after two months of use, i can confidently say that the blaupunkt bh41 is a reliable budget option that ticks most of the right boxes. the sound quality is enjoyable, the build is solid, and the battery life is impressive. however, the slightly outdated bluetooth, smaller ear cups, and lack of an included aux cable may be minor annoyances for some users.if you’re looking for a pair of budget-friendly headphones with decent sound and versatility, the bh41 is worth considering. while it’s not perfect, it offers enough value to make it a solid choice for everyday use.read more;

it's also about it being on time, and these earphones deliver that pretty well.comfort & passive noise isolation:comfort is key when it comes to neckbands, and the z2 doesn’t disappoint. they come with multiple earbud sizes, so you can pick the one that fits snugly for you. while there’s no active noise cancellation (anc) here, you can achieve a decent level of passive noise isolation by choosing the right ear tips. this makes a noticeable difference in cutting out background noise during commutes or at the office.app experience & annoying blinking light:now, onto a couple of quirks. the bullets z2 uses the heymelody app, which offers additional features like custom sound settings. however, my unit just wouldn’t connect with the app, which was a bummer. so, any fancy tweaks you could make through the app were out of my reach, and i had to rely solely on the default bluetooth pairing. while everything worked smoothly once connected, i feel like i missed out on some customization options that might have enhanced my experience.another thing that bugged me was the small white light that blinks when the neckband is connected to a device. it might not seem like a big deal, but if you’re using the earphones in a dark room or while lying down, that blinking light can be pretty distracting. plus, it probably drains the battery a bit, albeit a small amount. a simple option to turn this off in the app would’ve been a nice touch.final thoughts - a solid pick for most, with room for improvement:overall, the oneplus z2 delivers where it matters—good sound quality, reliable connectivity, and battery life that won’t have you constantly reaching for the charger. it’s not perfect, especially with the blinking light and app connectivity issues, but those are minor compared to the solid performance it offers. plus, with the quick-charge feature and low-latency gaming experience, it’s hard not to appreciate the value you get.if you’re looking for a reliable neckband that blends style, comfort, and balanced audio, the oneplus bullets z2 is definitely worth considering. it might not satisfy those who crave earth-shattering bass, but for most listeners, it's a worthy contender at its price point.read more;

there is nothing wrong with the looks of the bullets z2, they are actually quite decent looking. they are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. the middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, u shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. the wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. one of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the usb type c port on the side. you get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. the battery unit has the oneplus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.the earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. when the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. the bullets wireless z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. the material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. it also comes with an ip55 rating.pairing the oneplus bullets wireless z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. all you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. you can then look up the buds in the list of bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. once connected, the bullets z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.you get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, oneplus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), oneplus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. you have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. it may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.the oneplus bullets wireless z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of oneplus earphones- 12.4mm. the fact that oneplus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. the earbuds support two audio codecs, sbc and aac.as for the audio performance, the bullets wireless z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. while this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.if you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the bullets wireless z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.that said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the oneplus bullets wireless z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.the oneplus bullets wireless z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. we could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. as the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.they come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. but because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.the bullets wireless z2 also face some heat from the likes of oppo enco m32 and the realme buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. the oneplus bullets wireless z2 are actually a great proposition for the price;

i have been using various anc headphones for years and i bought these because my airpods pro got spoilt and i forgot my bose quiet control 30s at home while travelling. it looks pretty good with impressive fit and finish. the buttons feel well built yet the headphone is quite light. it did not hurt my ears even after long hours of continuous use.sound quality: i am an audio visual production professional and i felt it sounds quite balanced (for a jbl) in the eq off setting. pump up the volume and it can get pretty loud. the 'super bass' eq mode really pumps up the bass. the bass response is deep with precise attacks and releases, does not sound boomy at all. i like how these headphones sound. the calling quality too is surprisingly good. it cuts most ambient noises coming into the microphone while on a phone call.anc: does the job okay but there are much better anc headphones available in the market. compared to the bose quiet series, the apple airpods pro or even the sony headphones with anc these felt inferior. in my recent travel in an airplane, these headphones started crackling; especially while the airplane was taking off. the filtration of the aircraft engine sound kept varying throughout my three hours of flying.ergonomics: it takes a little while to get used to the position of the buttons. i felt that the anc on-off toggle button should have been placed on the other earpiece of the headphone and not along with the power button or the volume control/play-pause buttons. again, takes a while to get used to this button position. the charging port is on the top side of the right earpiece. thus, you cannot use the headphones while charging them. the wired connection option is definitely a handy option if you want to use them connected to a computer on a table. the wire is a trrs jack and kept playing in mono when connected to a trs only socket.battery backup: very good battery backup so even with a continuous use with anc for approx 6 hours and with about 60% volume on music and multiple phone calls, it just consumed 40% charge.overall verdict: it's a good buy only if you have budget constraints and you're offered hefty discounts. if not then there are far better anc headphones available in the market.read more;

this headphone is a bag of mixed feelings, but let me break down what is good about it and what is missing.on one hand i feel there is a lack of bass when i am listening to pop and upbeat music, but at the same time i works well when i am watching documentaries or doing editing as it enhances the audio by boosting its treble. so if you are a music lover and loves a lot of bass, it is not for you. you can amp up your bass from the device you have paired it to, but it doesn't hit anywhere close to premium bass quality. on the other hand if you watch a lot of content which involves dialogues and documentaries, this is the perfect headphone for you as it gives amazing speech clarity. i would say this is also an editors and gamers headphone, where communication is very important and speeches takes great importance over beats and rhythms. i like that we can swap between ambient aware and noise cancellation, and it's greatest pro is the battery life. this headphone as a very good battery life, you can run it for days without even realizing that you need to charge it. i use it for work, meetings and calls, and also for editing purpose, and i am happy with my purchase, but if i was a sound editor or into audio compositing i think there are better options in the market at the same price.read more;

i'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment i experienced with the noise two wirless. these headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.let's start with the build quality. imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. they weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.now, i'm a reasonable person. accidents happen. so, i contacted noise support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. what i got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. they dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).so, here i am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. the audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. my advice? steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.for those seeking a more constructive alternative:do your research! read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.prioritize build quality. look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.understand the warranty terms thoroughly. don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.read more;

review for h530. the build quality for the headphones is pretty good for the price, comfortable to wear, however they face some issues with volume. the headphone isn't loud enough, sound quality is also bad, my earphones have better sound quality and loudness compared to these headphones, didn't notice any directional audio when playing any game. the headphones come with various connectors, the usb is just for the led, it has a two pin connector for mic and audio and comes with an adapter for single jack output, i tried both and directly connecting two pin to pc makes the audio quality even worse so i would suggest using the adapter. overall i would suggest you keep looking for better headphones, these ones get the job done but if you care for audio quality them these won't satisfy you.edit: after 4 months of use, one side of the headphones stopped working, don't buy these, these are cheap common headphones to which the company only puts its brand stickers and sells, these are not manufactured buy ant, you can search on amazon and find these exact headphones being sold by other brands as well.read more;

the sound quality is decent and as expected for the price range.after two months of use, one side stopped working and then started the saga. i was asked to courier it to their address and since it was in middle of the lockdown, i couldn't send it and asked for alternate options but there was no response. after couple of weeks of sending reminders and not getting response, raised another complaint. item was couriered at my cost (rs 300) and awaiting for resolution. for a product which stopped working within 2 months, they should have had better resolution like a replacement or at least pickup service.read more;

i brought ant esports h350 gaming headset for online studying, gaming and also music. i love the rgb lights on the headphone which looks awesome. now for the sound and mic, in my opinion this is the best headphone ever in this price range which includes mic+audio to single jack for mobile which none other headphones include and sound quality is awesome. normal audio and also game sounds are clear, when we listen to music it gives clear point sound each and every instrument sound will be clear. i havent used other headphones so in my opinion this is best headphone. it is very comfortable to wear but when we use for long time there will be heat on ears. mic quality is awesome and controls also good. if you have realtek audio driver in your pc make sure to check the clear noices and other things and also keep mic audio boost so that your voice will be clear. nice thick cardboard box packing from amazon. no damages to the box and product.edit: be careful with the headphone wire connected to headphone left ear and don't pull or bend it because the headphone didn't work until i bend the wire after 45 days and so had to be sent for warranty. the acro engineering company oh my god! it took 30 days more for product replacement under warranty. but its working good now and please be careful with headphone wire joints of any headphone.read more;

battery backup is really not good. i run marathons, and it takes around 5hours to complete, but these earphones gets discharged in just 3hours.another downpoint is, it is very difficult to charge after few weeks of purchase, the charging pins in case dont detect earphones easily and i have to keep setting it properly in the case to make earphones charge, although the pins are magnetic, but it dont fit properly itself.next downpoint is, charging case dont get connected with my type c mobile charging cable, instead the they only get charge with the given type c cable, because of case design having curves and, depth of charging socket.there is no cover on case charging socket, due to which it gets sweat inside while keeping in clothes during running, which makes it vulnerable to sweat damage.during running, due to sweat getting over my earphones on ear, music gets on/off multiple times, and i have to start them again n again manually.the buttons in earphones dont work many times. i have click it multiple times to make them detect my touch fingers. earphones quality is definately cheap like low quality chinese earphones(didnt expected such quality having used boat rockerz 510 before which were really good in battery life and quality terms).the only reason i bought these was portability while running which is not possible with my boat rockerz 510.after few months of usage, the earpiece has become quite loose in wearing, which makes me afraid if it will get broken due to in/out multiple times.while i was making purchase, the product appeared to be small in size, but when i saw it, case is really big, earphones are really big. which makes it difficult to carry everywhere, put in my bag, compared to other tws i have used before like samsung buds live.case quality is very cheap, gets scratches very easily, battery backup of charging case is like 1.5 times charge for earpieces, that too sometimes it charges only 1 earpiece, not both completely. its stops charging without any indication that charging is complete or something.unfortunately boat brand is now involved into selling cheap and low quality product practices, which makes me think to shift to other brands for good quality, rather than thinking about made in india low quality products. thought boat products would last a lifetime, but they cant even last few months now. i have also used mivi tws open earphones before, and these boat earphones made me feel the same way. those mivi earphones were worst i have used in my life. and it also had similar issues like unable to fit in case itself properly, unable to charge earpieces itself at first, charging pins issues, charging case socket issues.read more;

i have been using various anc headphones for years and i bought these because my airpods pro got spoilt and i forgot my bose quiet control 30s at home while travelling. it looks pretty good with impressive fit and finish. the buttons feel well built yet the headphone is quite light. it did not hurt my ears even after long hours of continuous use.sound quality: i am an audio visual production professional and i felt it sounds quite balanced (for a jbl) in the eq off setting. pump up the volume and it can get pretty loud. the 'super bass' eq mode really pumps up the bass. the bass response is deep with precise attacks and releases, does not sound boomy at all. i like how these headphones sound. the calling quality too is surprisingly good. it cuts most ambient noises coming into the microphone while on a phone call.anc: does the job okay but there are much better anc headphones available in the market. compared to the bose quiet series, the apple airpods pro or even the sony headphones with anc these felt inferior. in my recent travel in an airplane, these headphones started crackling; especially while the airplane was taking off. the filtration of the aircraft engine sound kept varying throughout my three hours of flying.ergonomics: it takes a little while to get used to the position of the buttons. i felt that the anc on-off toggle button should have been placed on the other earpiece of the headphone and not along with the power button or the volume control/play-pause buttons. again, takes a while to get used to this button position. the charging port is on the top side of the right earpiece. thus, you cannot use the headphones while charging them. the wired connection option is definitely a handy option if you want to use them connected to a computer on a table. the wire is a trrs jack and kept playing in mono when connected to a trs only socket.battery backup: very good battery backup so even with a continuous use with anc for approx 6 hours and with about 60% volume on music and multiple phone calls, it just consumed 40% charge.overall verdict: it's a good buy only if you have budget constraints and you're offered hefty discounts. if not then there are far better anc headphones available in the market.read more;

this headphone is a bag of mixed feelings, but let me break down what is good about it and what is missing.on one hand i feel there is a lack of bass when i am listening to pop and upbeat music, but at the same time i works well when i am watching documentaries or doing editing as it enhances the audio by boosting its treble. so if you are a music lover and loves a lot of bass, it is not for you. you can amp up your bass from the device you have paired it to, but it doesn't hit anywhere close to premium bass quality. on the other hand if you watch a lot of content which involves dialogues and documentaries, this is the perfect headphone for you as it gives amazing speech clarity. i would say this is also an editors and gamers headphone, where communication is very important and speeches takes great importance over beats and rhythms. i like that we can swap between ambient aware and noise cancellation, and it's greatest pro is the battery life. this headphone as a very good battery life, you can run it for days without even realizing that you need to charge it. i use it for work, meetings and calls, and also for editing purpose, and i am happy with my purchase, but if i was a sound editor or into audio compositing i think there are better options in the market at the same price.read more;

i purchased boat rockerz 255 z plus. i got the order today and the package is good without any damage. but the issue is with the earphones. the left earbud is producing static noise and the sound is low compared to right side. it's not like it started after a few days or months. it started on same day as i received the order and just a few minutes after i started using. i don't know if everyone is facing this issue (saw similar comments on youtube and reviews) but this is causing very bad hearing experience. i assume it may be due to driver issue or wiring in left side. request to please take note of this feedback for both buyers and the boat companyread more;

the noise master buds genuinely surprised me — and in the best way possible. noise partnering with bose for sound tuning really shows in the final product. i honestly didn't expect this level of sound quality from an indian brand in this price range, but the audio clarity and balance are top-notch. the bass feels deep without overpowering, mids are clean, and the highs are crisp. whether you're listening to music or watching a movie, the sound feels immersive and natural.the active noise cancellation (anc) is another highlight — it can cut out a surprising amount of background noise. noise claims up to 49db of noise cancellation, and while i haven't measured it, the performance feels on par with some higher-end earbuds. even in crowded environments, the buds block out most distractions, making them perfect for travel or work.the design is sleek and minimal, with a comfortable fit that doesn't cause ear fatigue even after hours of use. the touch controls are responsive, and i love how you can customize them through the noise audio app.battery life is impressive too — i got close to the claimed 44 hours with the case, and the buds last around 8 hours on a single charge. the dual device pairing feature is super convenient, letting me switch between my laptop and phone without any hassle.overall, the noise master buds feel like a big step forward for indian audio brands. with bose's tuning and solid features like anc, spatial audio, and ldhc support, they easily compete with more expensive options.read more;

it's also about it being on time, and these earphones deliver that pretty well.comfort & passive noise isolation:comfort is key when it comes to neckbands, and the z2 doesn’t disappoint. they come with multiple earbud sizes, so you can pick the one that fits snugly for you. while there’s no active noise cancellation (anc) here, you can achieve a decent level of passive noise isolation by choosing the right ear tips. this makes a noticeable difference in cutting out background noise during commutes or at the office.app experience & annoying blinking light:now, onto a couple of quirks. the bullets z2 uses the heymelody app, which offers additional features like custom sound settings. however, my unit just wouldn’t connect with the app, which was a bummer. so, any fancy tweaks you could make through the app were out of my reach, and i had to rely solely on the default bluetooth pairing. while everything worked smoothly once connected, i feel like i missed out on some customization options that might have enhanced my experience.another thing that bugged me was the small white light that blinks when the neckband is connected to a device. it might not seem like a big deal, but if you’re using the earphones in a dark room or while lying down, that blinking light can be pretty distracting. plus, it probably drains the battery a bit, albeit a small amount. a simple option to turn this off in the app would’ve been a nice touch.final thoughts - a solid pick for most, with room for improvement:overall, the oneplus z2 delivers where it matters—good sound quality, reliable connectivity, and battery life that won’t have you constantly reaching for the charger. it’s not perfect, especially with the blinking light and app connectivity issues, but those are minor compared to the solid performance it offers. plus, with the quick-charge feature and low-latency gaming experience, it’s hard not to appreciate the value you get.if you’re looking for a reliable neckband that blends style, comfort, and balanced audio, the oneplus bullets z2 is definitely worth considering. it might not satisfy those who crave earth-shattering bass, but for most listeners, it's a worthy contender at its price point.read more;

there is nothing wrong with the looks of the bullets z2, they are actually quite decent looking. they are just a neckband, and this is what neckbands look like, and we have made our peace with it. the middle part is a thicker, slightly more stiff, u shaped-silicon band, with two chunky pill-shaped units at the end. the wires stem from these pills and have earbuds on the end. one of these pill-shaped units houses the battery, while the other has control options and the usb type c port on the side. you get volume buttons on this control unit and a multi-function play/pause button. the battery unit has the oneplus branding and the logo, while the volume buttons are highlighted in red.the earbuds on the end are pretty standard, with eartips on one side and a flat back with magnets. when the buds are attached together, they will simply stop playing the audio, which you can resume once you put them back in. the bullets wireless z2 are quite light and can be worn around the neck all day without ever feeling like a burden. the material used is quite skin-friendly and feels quite sturdy as well. it also comes with an ip55 rating.pairing the oneplus bullets wireless z2 is a pretty fuss-free process. all you have to do is press and hold the play/pause button, and the buds will go into pairing mode. you can then look up the buds in the list of bluetooth pairings on your device and connect the buds. once connected, the bullets z2 will connect to your phone automatically once you put them on.you get the usual volume buttons on the buds and another button in the middle in terms of controls. now instead of simply sharing the command load amongst its button comrades, oneplus has put all the burden on this one button in the middle. apart from the usual pairing/play/ pause/ call receiving/ call ending functions (which are already a lot for a single button), oneplus has also made it responsible for changing tracks. you have to press the button twice to skip to the next song and thrice to go back to the last song. it may all sound simple but can actually be chaotic in practice as you have to keep track of how many times you have pressed that tiny button before the command is completed.the oneplus bullets wireless z2 comes with the biggest drivers seen on a pair of oneplus earphones- 12.4mm. the fact that oneplus is offering such big drivers for under two thousand rupees is a major plus point for the buds. the earbuds support two audio codecs, sbc and aac.as for the audio performance, the bullets wireless z2 are pretty loud and come with plenty of bass, something that seems to be every brand’s audio formula in the budget segment. while this kind of signature sound gives the audio some faux body, it actually fails to deliver what the audio is truly supposed to sound like.if you are someone looking for a pair of earphones that offer balanced sound, then you might not like the sound profile that the bullets wireless z2 offer as they lack balance, majorly.that said, if you are someone who likes bass-heavy audio output and do not mind if some bass sneaks into your mids, then the oneplus bullets wireless z2 will definitely be your cup of tea.the oneplus bullets wireless z2 were pretty good in terms of call quality. we could hear the speaker clearly, and we heard no complaints whatsoever regarding our audio quality while using the buds. as the buds fit deep into your ear canals, they offer really good passive noise cancellation.they come with big 12.4 mm drivers, offer really long battery life, have a bass-heavy signature sound, and have a really solid build. but because the earbuds are really bass-heavy, they lack balance, and for those who like to listen to melodious or classical music, these might not be a great option.the bullets wireless z2 also face some heat from the likes of oppo enco m32 and the realme buds 2, which are priced in the same vicinity. the oneplus bullets wireless z2 are actually a great proposition for the price;

run long enough or not. cuz i needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.3.comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .4.sturdiness and build quality.5.looks obviously , pictures were good but i didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. not a single concern was founded to be true.1.mic is working absolutely fine. you can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. if you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). for all other purposes its perfect.2.i received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am i switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. it has been playing non stop. its perfect. if you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. you don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). battery life is sufficient. i haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. anyway , by what i've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. very comfortable. its definitely over the ears and completely covers them. even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. also , i dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , i've seen heavier gaming headphones. don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .4.build quality is very nice , sturdy and strong. the speakers are tightly held with the band and while i don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. it loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . the rgb looks so beautiful and catchy. the overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. everything is perfect. though i wish now that i should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... it would've looked cooler with rgb.6. with bluetooth , its justt awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ i like it (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). i don't play games so i can't talk bout latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. now talking bout the wired mode. it might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. the clarity is just perfect and no latency ofcourse. no need of battery in aux mode. can keep using it even if the battery is dead. i like this feature so much. for a student like me , its a charmer. no unnecessary breaks . and with the full sound ☠️ you won't hear even if someone's getting murderrred in the next room ☠️ its that awesome.  sound does leak , but its tooo loud as well. i mean , its like a freakin mini speaker on medium volume when you keep it aside and max the volume. it is crazyyyy . you can just hang it on your neck if it gets too hot n you'll still hear everything.it is honestly my very first wireless headphones. but i have used boat rockerz which my friend has , and i can say without a doubt , giving 200 more for this one is definitely worth it.the comfort , the looks , the loudness , the rgb (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). i even got 129 cashback so it had to be a steal deal for me 😁.i'm so glad i bought this as my first headphones. i was very skeptical but now that i'm using it 😍 , its just a wonderful experience.most negative comments i believe are one in hundred instances or anomaly or exceptions. most people don't review a product till it's defective. only very few people review when the product it perfect.this is to help first timers like me or for anyone who want a good headphone.don't worry bout anything , just go for it. luck can be bad sometimes nd you might get a bad piece , just get it replaced nd voila , problems solved. its not like 100% of manufactured products are bad ☠️. anyway.

nice , sturdy and strong. the speakers are tightly held with the band and while i don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. it loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . the rgb looks so beautiful and catchy. the overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. everything is perfect. though i wish now that i should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... it would've looked cooler with rgb.6. with bluetooth , its justt awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ i like it (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). i don't play games so i can't talk bout latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. now talking bout the wired mode. it might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. the clarity is just perfect and no latency ofcourse. no need of battery in aux mode. can keep using it even if the battery is dead. i like this feature so much. for a student like me , its a charmer. no unnecessary breaks . and with the full sound ☠️ you won't hear even if someone's getting murderrred in the next room ☠️ its that awesome.  sound does leak , but its tooo loud as well. i mean , its like a freakin mini speaker on medium volume when you keep it aside and max the volume. it is crazyyyy . you can just hang it on your neck if it gets too hot n you'll still hear everything.it is honestly my very first wireless headphones. but i have used boat rockerz which my friend has , and i can say without a doubt , giving 200 more for this one is definitely worth it.the comfort , the looks , the loudness , the rgb (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). i even got 129 cashback so it had to be a steal deal for me 😁.i'm so glad i bought this as my first headphones. i was very skeptical but now that i'm using it 😍 , its just a wonderful experience.most negative comments i believe are one in hundred instances or anomaly or exceptions. most people don't review a product till it's defective. only very few people review when the product it perfect.this is to help first timers like me or for anyone who want a good headphone.don't worry bout anything , just go for it. luck can be bad sometimes nd you might get a bad piece , just get it replaced nd voila , problems solved. its not like 100% of manufactured products are bad ☠️. anyway. ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.read more; the media could not be loaded.before receiving the product, these were my concerns:-1. alot of reviews were bout how the mic is bad , hence i was concerned.2. worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. cuz i needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.3.comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .4.sturdiness and build quality.5.looks obviously , pictures were good but i didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. not a single concern was founded to be true.1.mic is working absolutely fine. you can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. if you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). for all other purposes its perfect.2.i received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am i switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. it has been playing non stop. its perfect. if you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. you don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). battery life is sufficient. i haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. anyway , by what i've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. very

put straight for 2 to 3 hours, after it might feel a bit discomfort, depends on person to person. great battery, brand claims 40hr and i get too around 38 to 39hr in it which says its approved for long hours. very good sound quality, if you are confused between two headphones in this budget and you like bass more, then pick this one it has great bass. so everything is good, but there is one major, very big problem which is kinda aceeptable for someone and not for a lot of pepole. the problem is sound leakage, if you listen even above 50% vol or for some songs even at 30% vol, the sound starts to get outside earphone. your experience won't get bad for urself but the outsiders could also hear it which is why its not good to use it in public. if u go on 90% volume, rather than a headphone it becomes a speaker, u won't face any problem in ears, but voice outside will come loud easily hearable. it means brand gave everything, but could not block the speakers towards the outer end meaning voice gets outside easilyread more; great budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together. great build

earphones are more comfortable for long use where as over the ear kind compresses the skull.; 3.5/5i have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. i got it for a nice deal (approx. rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). i was reviewing multiple headphones under the rs. 5k range. my first choice was the sony ch-520, but i did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and i didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under rs. 5k). the other options were boat, zebronics (a different set), hammer and a variety of other ones.among them i did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. i wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. it was available at a reasonable price and the rgb lights impressed me. so i ordered them.pros:- sounds good! i'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. no issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. the bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- sturdy. the headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. while laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. i have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. they are still in good shape- rgb. the lights are definitely funky. they look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- battery. applaudable battery without hesitation. i use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.cons:- mic. i've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. my peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what i just said- huge cushions and ear muffs! the size of the muffs are simply too big. when traveling with the headphones on in buses, i like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. but this is simply not possibly with these headphones. the muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. when i try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. so i'm forced to sit rigid for a while- terrible button placement. the power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. this makes it very hard to use the controls. i have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. it's so ridiculous that i stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- bad usb-c connection slot. the usb-c connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other usb-c wires because it has a narrow deep opening. so my phone's usb-c charger doesn't fit in it. only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. this means i always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackoverall decent pair. in my previous (edited now) review, i mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. after several days i realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. so, i have edited my review and updated the ratingcheers!read more; 3.5/5i have been using these headphones for over 2 months

the neckband offers a mix of pros and cons that you should consider before purchasing.pros1. design:the neckband boasts a sporty design, making it ideal for activities like gym workouts, cycling, or jogging. it’s more suited for an active lifestyle rather than a formal or classy look.2. connectivity:while it lacks the ability to connect to two devices simultaneously and only supports bluetooth 5.0 (instead of newer versions), it still excels in quickly pairing with the connected device. this makes it reliable enough to count as a positive.3. music quality:considering its budget-friendly price, the music quality is decent. it offers a satisfactory listening experience for casual use.4. durability and build quality:although i’ve only had it for a week, the build quality seems superior compared to the low-grade products commonly found in the same price range. while it doesn’t have a premium look, it feels sturdier than typical budget options. i'll provide an update on its long-term durability later.cons1. battery life:the battery life falls short of the company's claims, lasting only 3–4 hours. this isn’t uncommon for budget-friendly neckbands, as lightweight, high-quality batteries are typically reserved for premium models. however, the false advertising by the company is disappointing.2. button placement:the volume and power buttons are placed too close to each other, making it difficult to differentiate between them. this may lead to accidental call disconnections while adjusting the volume. although it’s not a major issue, it can be inconvenient.read more;

i had two bose acoustimass 5 modules and one polk audio cs20 center channel for my home theater system for the past few years. the bose modules are still performing excellently, and i always admire their superb quality.for my pc, i initially used zebronics headphones along with the dts:x windows app. however, these headphones never satisfied my ears. after researching online, i narrowed down my options to sony or sennheiser to fulfill my audiophile needs.i visited a sony showroom and tried their high-end ult sony headphones. the bass and noise cancellation were below average, and the on-ear experience was quite disappointing.after comparing the sound quality of bose, sony, and zebronics, i decided to do more research. eventually, i discovered that the sennheiser accentum or accentum plus might be a good fit for me. however, i found that wireless and noise-canceling headphones are never truly perfect across brands.after further exploration, i settled on the sennheiser hd 560s headphones. i purchased them and tested the same song i had listened to at the sony showroom. my first impression was that my decision to buy the sennheiser hd 560s was absolutely correct.priced at ₹12,000, these headphones offer:absolutely crystal-clear sound quality.bass that is above average, though not comparable to the bose acoustimass 5 home theater setup.when i watched the war scene from unbroken in dolby atmos using the hd 560s, it reminded me of the opening scene of saving private ryan with a similar impactful effect provided by the bose acoustimass 5.listening to many a.r. rahman songs on the hd 560s, i can confidently say these are the best headphones available in the ₹12,000 budget range.over-ear comfort is much better than the on-ear sony headphones i tried.the open-back design leaks a slight amount of sound outward, but the crystal-clear audio ensures a truly immersive experience without being disturbed by external noise.the cable length is sufficient for my pc setup.no issues with wireless connectivity or noise-cancellation confusion—just a pure, wired soundstage experience.the packaging was excellent, and amazon’s delivery service was, as always, superb.read more;

abbandonato dalla tecnologia ad ottobre (rme-adi2 e sundara morti...) e prevedendo un regalo natalizio da qualche familiare per rimpiazzare le cuffie, ho optato per questo modello entry level, mentre per il dac/ampli ho optato per un topping dx3pro+ (non comprato pero' su amazon per via dei tempi biblici di consegna).beh, sono rimasto piacevolmente sorpreso. il timbro sonoro è diverso dalla linea 600 e 500 della sennheiser. queste cuffie sono effettivamente piu' analitiche e hanno un'ottima scena sonora che mi ha veramente sorpreso. la timbrica è meno calda della serie 600 e in certi momenti sembrano quasi degli iem di altà qualità dando un senso di maggior definizione degli strumenti. ho letto recensori che si lamentano di bassi invadenti, ma in realtà a me sembrano perfettamente equilibrati e mai sovrastanti o ""sbordanti"" sui medi. mi piace il fatto che non siano bombastici come molte cuffie di gamma bassa come queste. i medi sono ottimi anche loro e le voci dettagliate e pulite. l'unico appunto che faccio a queste cuffie è un'eccessiva enfasi sulle frequenze alte che pur non essendo affaticante, a me personalmente da un po' fastidio. ad onor del vero questa ""secchezza"" degli alti era maggiormante presente all'inizio degli ascolti, mentre piano piano con il passare delle ore sembra meno evidente. se devo essere sincero non rimpiango le hifiman che comunque tendevano anche loro ad enfatizzare un po' gli alti e a ""colorare"" un po' i medi. per contro mi sembravano piu' ""reattive"" e dinamiche nelle transizioni musicali e nella ricostruzione della scena sonora (ma stiamo parlando di sottigliezze appena percepibili). che dire, secondo me un gran paio di cuffie ad un prezzo abbordabilissimo. io le consiglio a tutti coloro che vogliano una cuffia dall'ottimo rapporto prezzo/qualità.  anche perchè per cuffie di un certo livello di prezzo consiglio sempre un ascolto diretto (no youtube e simili) perchè ce ne sono molte che suonano in maniera orribile o che comunque potrebbe non piacervi (al mio orecchio ad esempio le grado sono inascoltabili, e le beyerdynamic mi stancano...). i materiali sono plasticosi ma robusti il giusto e la comodità ottima.bella sorpresa. le usero' con piacere, anche perchè....a natale non mi hanno regalato nulla!!!umpfaggiornamento: le ho collegate ad un mojo 2 ed é accaduta la magia. il suono ha preso vita e quella freddezza è precisione dell'accoppiata col topping è sparita. suoni caldi, corposi, rotondi, analogici. una vera goduria. quindi una cuffia da 150 euro che se accoppiata al giusto dac può diventare una cuffia da 500 euro....read more;

these are super comfortable, crystal clear sounding  referees headphones with good imaging and due to beeing good referees they are lacking some bass (when you run on ifi dac/amp with xbass/true bass the problem is gone, they are quiet good too for their price, and you'll need an amp +/or dac with amp sooner or later for these, so ifi does good job for not so much money).the only downsides is because of the low price the whole thing except the grill and drivers is plastic and you need amp to run them properly. you can connect them straight to the laptop or phone, but they won't be so good.for their price i can say it's one of the best picks from quality/cost view.and as always (for me) amazon delivery was good. the package was delivered on time and it wasn't devastated.read more;

media could not be loaded.before receiving the product, these were my concerns:-1. alot of reviews were bout how the mic is bad , hence i was concerned.2. worried about whether the battery will truly run long enough or not. cuz i needed it to work for atleast 10-12 hours.3.comfort level , as many comments mentioned that its too heavy .4.sturdiness and build quality.5.looks obviously , pictures were good but i didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. not a single concern was founded to be true.1.mic is working absolutely fine. you can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. if you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). for all other purposes its perfect.2.i received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am i switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. it has been playing non stop. its perfect. if you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. you don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). battery life is sufficient. i haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. anyway , by what i've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. very comfortable. its definitely over the ears and completely covers them. even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. also , i dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , i've seen heavier gaming headphones. don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .4.build quality is very nice , sturdy and strong. the speakers are tightly held with the band and while i don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. it loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . the rgb looks so beautiful and catchy. the overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. everything is perfect. though i wish now that i should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... it would've looked cooler with rgb.6. with bluetooth , its justt awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ i like it (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). i don't play games so i can't talk bout latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. now talking bout the wired mode. it might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. the clarity is just perfect and no latency ofcourse. no need of battery in aux mode. can keep using it even if the battery is dead. i like this feature so much. for a student like me , its a charmer. no unnecessary breaks . and with the full sound ☠️ you won't hear even if someone's getting murderrred in the next room ☠️ its that awesome.  sound does leak , but its tooo loud as well. i mean , its like a freakin mini speaker on medium volume when you keep it aside and max the volume. it is crazyyyy . you can just hang it on your neck if it gets too hot n you'll still hear everything.it is honestly my very first wireless headphones. but i have used boat rockerz which my friend has , and i can say without a doubt , giving 200 more for this one is definitely worth it.the comfort , the looks , the loudness , the rgb (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). i even got 129 cashback so it had to be a steal deal for me 😁.i'm so glad i bought this as my first headphones. i was very skeptical but now that i'm using it 😍 , its just a wonderful experience.most negative comments i believe are one in hundred instances or anomaly or exceptions. most people don't review a product till it's defective. only very few people review when the product it perfect.this is to help first timers like me or for anyone who want a good headphone.don't worry bout anything , just go for it. luck can be bad sometimes nd you might get a bad piece , just get it replaced nd voila , problems solved. its not like 100% of manufactured products are bad ☠️. anyway. ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.read more; the media could not be loaded.before receiving the product, these were my concerns:-1. alot of reviews were bout how the mic is

its too heavy .4.sturdiness and build quality.5.looks obviously , pictures were good but i didn't know how it'll actually look irl.6.quality n loudness of sound while in aux mode as many mentioned it gets reduced in wired mode.now , by the title , you must've figured out my first impression of the product. not a single concern was founded to be true.1.mic is working absolutely fine. you can't expect it to catch very low voice like in earphones or mics which are right at your mouth. if you speak in a normal tone , it works just fine. now if you want to talk to your girlfriend at night , then go for a wired earphones please (⁠≧⁠▽⁠≦⁠). for all other purposes its perfect.2.i received the product today at 9:10 and at 9:15am i switched it on at 70% , now its 2:13 and its still showing 70%. it has been playing non stop. its perfect. if you switch off the lights and use medium- above medium sound level , you'll easily be able to use it 12+ hours. you don't need to destroy your eardrums with full sound do you , unless its your favourite song (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). battery life is sufficient. i haven't charged it to 100% and then use it even once till now , will do that tonight. anyway , by what i've seen yet , its batterylife is awesome.3. firstly , the cushions are veryyy comfy n fluffy. very comfortable. its definitely over the ears and completely covers them. even the neck rest is perfectly cushioned. also , i dunno what others are talkin bout , it aint that heavy , i've seen heavier gaming headphones. don't be a whiny , weakling , wuss ╮⁠(⁠╯⁠_⁠╰⁠)⁠╭ .4.build quality is very nice , sturdy and strong. the speakers are tightly held with the band and while i don't think there is an inherent flaw in the design , but still its always good to handle it with care (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).5. it loooks freakinnn amazinnn (⁠✯⁠ᴗ⁠✯⁠) . the rgb looks so beautiful and catchy. the overall texture is also very smooth n attractive . is definitely a little big , but what else do you expect from a over the ear headphone༼⁠⁰⁠o⁠⁰⁠；⁠༽. everything is perfect. though i wish now that i should've gone with the black colour only (⁠●⁠_⁠_⁠●⁠).... it would've looked cooler with rgb.6. with bluetooth , its justt awesome n perfect. if you're using better quality sound then it'll not tear up no matter how loud you go. though with heavy bass , all that boom boom makes the headphones vibrate like crazy ヾ⁠(⁠*⁠’⁠ｏ⁠’⁠*⁠)⁠/ i like it (⁠人⁠ ⁠•͈⁠ᴗ⁠•͈⁠). i don't play games so i can't talk bout latency while playing , but in normal usage , wireless mode doesn't give anyyy issue to complaint about. now talking bout the wired mode. it might reduce the full volume by a very thin margin , but then the clarity is something to be desired for. the clarity is just perfect and no latency ofcourse. no need of battery in aux mode. can keep using it even if the battery is dead. i like this feature so much. for a student like me , its a charmer. no unnecessary breaks . and with the full sound ☠️ you won't hear even if someone's getting murderrred in the next room ☠️ its that awesome.  sound does leak , but its tooo loud as well. i mean , its like a freakin mini speaker on medium volume when you keep it aside and max the volume. it is crazyyyy . you can just hang it on your neck if it gets too hot n you'll still hear everything.it is honestly my very first wireless headphones. but i have used boat rockerz which my friend has , and i can say without a doubt , giving 200 more for this one is definitely worth it.the comfort , the looks , the loudness , the rgb (⁠ ⁠ꈍ⁠ᴗ⁠ꈍ⁠). i even got 129 cashback so it had to be a steal deal for me 😁.i'm so glad i bought this as my first headphones. i was very skeptical but now that i'm using it 😍 , its just a wonderful experience.most negative comments i believe are one in hundred instances or anomaly or exceptions. most people don't review a product till it's defective. only very few people review when the product it perfect.this is to help first timers like me or for anyone who want a good headphone.don't worry bout anything , just go for it. luck can be bad sometimes nd you might get a bad piece , just get it replaced nd voila , problems solved. its not like 100% of manufactured products are bad ☠️. anyway. ending it here , if you thinkin of buying this , go for it.read more; the media could not be

put straight for 2 to 3 hours, after it might feel a bit discomfort, depends on person to person. great battery, brand claims 40hr and i get too around 38 to 39hr in it which says its approved for long hours. very good sound quality, if you are confused between two headphones in this budget and you like bass more, then pick this one it has great bass. so everything is good, but there is one major, very big problem which is kinda aceeptable for someone and not for a lot of pepole. the problem is sound leakage, if you listen even above 50% vol or for some songs even at 30% vol, the sound starts to get outside earphone. your experience won't get bad for urself but the outsiders could also hear it which is why its not good to use it in public. if u go on 90% volume, rather than a headphone it becomes a speaker, u won't face any problem in ears, but voice outside will come loud easily hearable. it means brand gave everything, but could not block the speakers towards the outer end meaning voice gets outside easilyread more; great budget headphones with cool look with great rgb lights which you can on and off anytime by just presing vol+ and vol- both together. great build

levels, sometimes distorts a little at high specificly there's a monster mode at that.this is my first over the ear headphone even though the design is comfortable sounds good, i feel separated earphones are more comfortable for long use where as over the ear kind compresses the skull.; 3.5/5i have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. i got it for a nice deal (approx. rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). i was reviewing multiple headphones under the rs. 5k range. my first choice was the sony ch-520, but i did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and i didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under rs. 5k). the other options were boat, zebronics (a different set), hammer and a variety of other ones.among them i did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. i wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. it was available at a reasonable price and the rgb lights impressed me. so i ordered them.pros:- sounds good! i'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. no issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. the bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- sturdy. the headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. while laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. i have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. they are still in good shape- rgb. the lights are definitely funky. they look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- battery. applaudable battery without hesitation. i use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.cons:- mic. i've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. my peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what i just said- huge cushions and ear muffs! the size of the muffs are simply too big. when traveling with the headphones on in buses, i like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. but this is simply not possibly with these headphones. the muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. when i try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. so i'm forced to sit rigid for a while- terrible button placement. the power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. this makes it very hard to use the controls. i have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. it's so ridiculous that i stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- bad usb-c connection slot. the usb-c connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other usb-c wires because it has a narrow deep opening. so my phone's usb-c charger doesn't fit in it. only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. this means i always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackoverall decent pair. in my previous (edited now) review, i mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. after several days i realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. so, i have edited my review and updated the ratingcheers!read more; 3.5/5i have been using these headphones for over 2 months

i recently purchased a jbl earphone, expecting a high-quality sound experience based on the brand's reputation. however, i was quite disappointed with the overall performance. the sound quality is not as good as i had hoped—it lacks clarity, depth, and bass, which makes listening to music or watching videos less enjoyable. the audio often feels flat, and the highs and lows are not well balanced. i had chosen jbl because of its strong presence in the audio market and positive reviews, but unfortunately, this particular product did not meet my expectations.i believe that for the price i paid, there are better options available with richer sound and better comfort. i was genuinely looking forward to enjoying music on the go, but this product has left me unsatisfied. i would appreciate it if jbl could look into improving the audio tuning and overall performance of this model in future versions.i am now looking for a proper earphone that delivers clear sound, good bass, and consistent performance—something i can rely on daily for both entertainment and calls. hopefully, my feedback can help others make a more informed choice.read more;

i got tired of buying cheap headphones that break easily and don't regret paying extra for these at all. i've been frustrated why so many companies try to save a few cents making such thin cords that break in a few months only to lose money replacing them on warranty. this actually has a cord built to last and it's coiled so it's flexible. the cord is a bit short though for my setup so i use a cord extension to make sure it doesn't get tugged and damaged.i'm not an audio professional but the sound quality is amazing to me and a lot more natural sounding. the bass it has feels like having a subwoofer. the frequency response is rated for 8 hz but from my testing at typical listening volume levels it can only noticeably play tones as low as 11 hz, which is still pretty good. it also surprisingly blocks out a lot of outside noise too, about half as much as the hearing protection i use at work.i also love that they're comfortable and so adjustable. i like to pull one side behind my ear while singing so i can hear myself and they still fit to my head perfectly.read more;

are the best headphones from sony. previously i used sony headphones but they're entry-level headphones.  i also used headphones from other brands like sennheiser, one audio and jbl but all of them are entry-level headphones. this is the first time i bought high-end headphones and i trust sony. you can't go wrong with sony as per my experience. coming to the headphones, i already knew that these were best. however, i researched thoroughly on youtube and read many articles for almost 3 months before buying these. i want to get the best value for the price. these headphones are costly and i don't want to go wrong with my purchase decision.build quality: these are made of high-quality plastic and feel lightweight and comfortable to wear for longer durations. the only thing is, that the headband is thin and hurts a little on my head after wearing it for a few hours. just move or adjust it a little and i'm good to go for another hour.sound quality: it's sony, no need to brag about sound quality. sony is known for sound clarity. every small musical instrument is heard in great detail. i can't forget my first experience of listening to music using these headphones. i'm blown away by the details and the clarity of sound.battery life: it is mentioned 30 hours. seems to be true. headphones will easily last up to two days of mixed usage.noise cancellation (n.c.): these headphones are my first experience with noise cancellation. when nc is turned on, it is silent. zero noise. but after a few days,  i realised that i could still hear voices from other people when they were shouting or talking loudly. it's good not to completely block all sound.update on n.c.:i want to address one thing people who are saying that nc is not good. i think they feel like that because of the adaptive nc feature in the sony headphones app. due to this feature, the level of noise cancelling is adjusted automatically according to the surroundings. i know it doesn't work 100% accurately every time. it works sort of 70 - 80 % accurately depending on the surroundings. that's why some people complain that nc is not completely silent or perfect. some are complaining there is no option to disable the adaptive nc feature. it is available in the sony headphones app after the latest update. we can also manually disable the adaptive nc of headphones using the app. i mentioned these details because some people may not be aware of these features available in the headphones app.note: when nc is turned on, a sound pressure is created between ears and headphones. so there is a vacuum-like seal between ears and headphones and it blocks external sound. i'm not sure how nc works. this is the first time for me experienced noise cancellation. it was a shock and a surprise feeling when nc was on. my brother got scared due to this effect. i got used to it now. check the sony manual regarding the safety of nc. in the sony headphones connect app, there is a safe listening setting. please follow it and you don't need to worry about your ears getting damaged due to headphones. i have attached screenshots of the same. please check.final verdict: i can say that these headphones are the best consumer headphones. audiophile headphones are different that's why i mentioned them as the best consumer headphones. most people who use them will love them.read more; these are the best

always of the belief that they have the best music reproduction with lossless audio from apps like apple music. was seriously wanting to try the xms when the xm4 was launched but wasn’t happy with the reviews of mic quality as i generally take calls for more than 7 hours on my work days. but when xm5s came in was tempted to try them after the reviews paying more details on the improved mic quality. i wanted to give it a try and tried the music when i was in france in a store, but the sound quality was very poor since the store let me use it only with their wired audio source and said no to try with my phone. back in india i tried again once in a store using my phone and apple music and boy o boy i was proved wrong!!! i was simply blown over on how the headphones were clear with the spatial audio even with the default eq setting. i’m not a bass heavy person but rather love the different tones and this is a pro quality one in that. with the anc microphones it was even a blessing that the call trials(both with ms teams and phone) i did were fantastic. decided to grab this and ordered in amazon when it was available for around 28k net with cashback and i would say this is the best investment i had made. the dual connectivity, monstrous battery back up, anc combined with the best mic makes it a great headphone one can ever have. the size and case as most say as negative isn’t a problem at all. the build also is good and this is a keeper. if you are not worried about the budget and need a headphone that u can use for both work(calls) and music blindly go for this.. 👍🏻read

it is disappointing.build and design: i had used these headphones for more than week and i would say device is very comfortable for longer use ( watching movies) , quite light weight , controls are easy to use, touch response is fast with almost no delay.audio: well i am not used to over the ears devices so i cant compare to others but its great overall. bit bassy for my liking and little less bright u can say but it can be easily fixed by eq. so no problems there ( may be brand had tuned it for more neutral profile) .after eq tuning these are mostly excellent for songs , movies podcast etc.also audio quality depends upon you device too. as i tested it on low end mobile and high end devices, u can observe difference.noise cancellation:  i bought these for work at home , typically coding, study research papers , as people can get really vocal and for analysing complex articles you need silence. as per all reviews these are one of the best but you need to keep your expectation realistic. you can easily hear person talking at moderate volume in same room( reduce by a bit ) or even to next room if someone it talking loud or moderately loud.but if in next room people are talking a moderately low volume you wont hear them same is for tv, at high volume you will definitly hear it.( you can play some white noise or music than you minimise other noise.)what more to consider: these cut other background noise like of ac ( almost completely ) , birds, other typical noises. it can get little uncomfortable( unnatural silence 😂) for some in begining. you also hear people because it cut other backgroud noise so much that even little things are more highlighted.for other: if you are buying these for listening music and watching movies while travel it will cut every thing while playing music or movies. maybe these are designed for this purpose.pass though mode: as per my opinion its great , almost natural with no delay,battery i didnt tested extensively that how much time it can go but i feel more than sufficient  easily last for  couple of days  if using 5-6 hours a day, charging is also fast so no worries there.biggest bummer for me. its no surprise that there is no dolby atmos support. i think for this price it should be there, as sony 360 audio is not supported at all platforms n very less content is available. so for spatial audio doby should had been there. i had used other product with dolby it makes huge impact.read more; 4 star rating just for bad packing from seller as there are no packing material on the box. seller

periquitos australianos e com o nc ativado ainda da pra escutar o piado deles, porém se vc colocar uma música de fundo ai desaparece todos os sons ao redor e vc fica isolado.qualidade de som nas músicas é excelente, porém tenho um astro a40 que uso no playstation e prefiro o som do astro com a mixamp tanto pra músicas como filmes e séries.em relação ao conforto achei confortável, dá pra usar por bastante tempo, porém achei o espaço para orelhas muito raso, as orelhas encostam e é oq faz ter que dar umas pausas, oq por exemplo não ocorre com o astro a40 que o espaço é bem maior, mais confortável, a orelha não encosta e daria pra ficar o dia inteiro com ele, nesse quesito também gostaria de citar o anker life q30 que era o headphone que usava antes desse, acho o anker mais confórtável, embora perca no nc e qualidade sonora.por fim o investimento foi grande, mais nosso problema é a taxação e o real que não vale nada comparado com o dólar, espero que o headphone dure muito tempo, pois realizei a compra por conta do meu anker life q30 com 1 ano e meio de uso parou de funcionar o noise cancel e descascou todo e abriu a parte da espuma, levando em conta que o anker custa em medio r$ 400 e o sony r$ 2500 espero que se reflita na durabilidade.read more; the media could not be loaded.o headphone é premium, apresentação, acessórios, emfim o produto é top, padrão

produto, depois de um certo tempo de uso, comprei o mesmo, para estudos,  ouvir musicas diariamente e  principalmente pelo cancelamento de ruídos. moro em um local onde as pessoas tem cachorros e usam

necessidades diárias.quanto potência do som,  eu achei excelente, para as minhas necessidades,  existe um modo de personalizar o equalizador  conforme  o gosto e cada um.o vendedor é muito atencioso, responde as perguntas rapidamente, o produto chegou uns dias antes do prazo.tive outros 2 fones de uma marca famosa (j..) e não chega aos pés deste fone. quem está desesperado precisando de

within reach of your budget or a bit of a stretch more, you would not regret the purchase afterwards. still have not gone through all the features, functions, and app but based just based off the sound alone i am extremely satisfied; sony wh-1000xm5 wireless industry leading noise cancelling headphones with auto noise cancelling optimizer, crystal clear hands-free calling, and alexa voice control, blackwell i finally felt time to upgrade my headphones. i've been using the old boss quiet comfort 3's.  quite dated i know. but it lasted me a very long time.  it's done well for menow after much time passed i finally picked up this sony xm5.my comparison is with that old headphone.  perhaps not the best apples to apples fairness.  i don't look for studio reference flat sound with these . i look daily music listening whilst working. something to work out with.  something that has good enough clarity in highs and deep bass for pop music.  my high fi lilistening is done by wired headphones which is a total other category of audiophile gear.for these i need superb noise cancelling that is superior to bose .  i need exciting lively bass tightness and crispy highs without harshness.  a good mic for conference calls.  an ambient mode to use when jogging.this sony xm5 delivers and tldr i can easily replace my bose qm3 with these.1. sound .  first thing i noticed immediately... this has ultra tight bass .  bass is as deep as you want it. and can be set to create a super tight quick reacting bass.  very satisfying in all musical genres.  wayyy exceeds bose bass performance which imo was its weakest point .  by default thigh highs are flat and lifeless but after a super quick eqing session i got it to my preferred listening and it sounds amazing.  i'm very happy with the sound. it feels smooth and unfatiguing when i want it... and then it can be eq'd to be clinically sharp but not harsh.... whenever you feel like it.  it is hands down a huge step above bose.2. noise cancelling.  tldr?  huge upgrade over bose qc3.  it's dead quiet.  it is scare silent actually... really eerie.  i love this because i turn it on and just use it as a way to work i'm office without the hum of the hvac system.3. ambient mode.  the sony app allows you to adjust the levels to satisfy how much exterior sound to leak into your headphones. i like this.  it also allows you to setup detection mode to allow you to swap to ambient mode automatically when you talk and have conversations.... music stops.  after 15 seconds the ambient mode reverts back to noise reduction mode and resumes music.  really handy.  love it.3. mic for conference calls.  absolutely outstanding without premature cutting off of voice which is a common issue with these headphone mics... bose suffered from this greatly.  this is crystal clear mic and no issues using this in professional conference calls.4.  tap controls.. very simple straight forward. uses a swipe or tap setup on the right ear.  the entire right side ear flat side is a drawing board .  large surface area makes for superbly reliable gestures that make it consistent and easy to control.  swiping up and down is volume.  swiping fwd or back is tracks.  double tapping pause and resumes.  theres no way to adjust the gesture actions on the app. .nor is there a way to make the left side become gesture side in case you prefer left side .... it's only right side.  to me it is not a show stopper but perhaps for others it could be. the only other buttons is the anc button to toggle noise cancelling mode and ambient mode.  you can program double or triple clicking of the button to launch spotify or other music apps but i only use double tap for spotify.  the other button is on/off / pairing.  this isn't customizable.  i would have liked to see a bit more customizable actions here but it's ok... sometimes it's better to have more simplicity.  oh by the way you can turn off the tap swipe gestures entirely  case you find this to be annoying with accidental taps especially when you're wearing the headphones laying down5. automatic modes.  based on location , you can have your phone help detect location and automatically set your profile for you. example if you're working , set noise cancelling ... or if it detects jogging then setup ambient mode . etc... handy but not something i would use.  i like to be in control.6. comfort.  this is a really light weight product. very comfortable. wraps fully account ear.  theres no issue with long wear time because it's so light and feels great.  the vinyl material wraps the  foam and doesn't feel sweaty .  you can replace this with other materials ( third party).  lots out there.  i really wished there are larger labelling of l and r to quickly visually see which side is right.  it's a tiny little r on the inside of the headphone head piece ... the bose had a huge r and l on the inside of the headphone ear foam so it's hidden front he outside but still stealthy.  i get that sonys design for these headphones are minimalist stealthy look but the r and l could've been larger and still stealthy.7. this uses usbc. and charges quick and lasts a long time.  whilst not as long as my bose,  it's long enough for me to be reliable to last me entire day and more. no problem. i have no issues here.  it's fantastic.8. the sony connect app is clean and easy to use.  it's what unlocks the sony headphones to another level.  much better than bose software.  you need it for eq and various profiles .  without it you're going to miss out.so to conclude i'm gonna give it huge 5 star rating. rare for me.  it's a fantastic device.  huge upgrade from my bose qc3.  really happy with this so far.  and what made it a great buy from me is i've found it in amazon warehouse open box pricing.  you can't beat that .hope this helpsread more; sony wh-1000xm5 wireless industry leading noise cancelling headphones with auto noise cancelling

there a way to make the left side become gesture side in case you prefer left side .... it's only right side.  to me it is not a show stopper but perhaps for others it could be. the only other buttons is the anc button to toggle noise cancelling mode and ambient mode.  you can program double or triple clicking of the button to launch spotify or other music apps but i only use double tap for spotify.  the other button is on/off / pairing.  this isn't customizable.  i would have liked to see a bit more customizable actions here but it's ok... sometimes it's better to have more simplicity.  oh by the way you can turn off the tap swipe gestures entirely  case you find this to be annoying with accidental taps especially when you're wearing the headphones laying down5. automatic modes.  based on location , you can have your phone help detect location and automatically set your profile for you. example if you're working , set noise cancelling ... or if it detects jogging then setup ambient mode . etc... handy but not something i would use.  i like to be in control.6. comfort.  this is a really light weight product. very comfortable. wraps fully account ear.  theres no issue with long wear time because it's so light and feels great.  the vinyl material wraps the  foam and doesn't feel sweaty .  you can replace this with other materials ( third party).  lots out there.  i really wished there are larger labelling of l and r to quickly visually see which side is right.  it's a tiny little r on the inside of the headphone head piece ... the bose had a huge r and l on the inside of the headphone ear foam so it's hidden front he outside but still stealthy.  i get that sonys design for these headphones are minimalist stealthy look but the r and l could've been larger and still stealthy.7. this uses usbc. and charges quick and lasts a long time.  whilst not as long as my bose,  it's long enough for me to be reliable to last me entire day and more. no problem. i have no issues here.  it's fantastic.8. the sony connect app is clean and easy to use.  it's what unlocks the sony headphones to another level.  much better than bose software.  you need it for eq and various profiles .  without it you're going to miss out.so to conclude i'm gonna give it huge 5 star rating. rare for me.  it's a fantastic device.  huge upgrade from my bose qc3.  really happy with this so far.  and what made it a great buy from me is i've found it in amazon warehouse open box pricing.  you can't beat that .hope this helps",headphones,8

pros: has great low and mids. perfect bluetooth connectivity with 2 devices. switch between the audios is flawless. it allows me to switch between listening to music from mobile and connect to office calls. sturdy design which looks premium. it has button controlls instead of touch, personally i like it this way as it won't have any accidental change of settings. comfortable wear with soft padding. decent bass. soundcore app works fine as well. charges quite fastcons: i don't think anc is that effective as i don't feel any noticable difference between anc-normal-transparency mode. sounds better in normal mode than in anc. supports hi-res audio via auxiliary cable, but didn't notice any significant difference(may be because i am not that big an audiophile). no carry pouch is provided, so need to be careful.overall, it is a great headset with really good sound quality that does justice to it's price point.read more;

i purchased boat rockerz 255 z plus. i got the order today and the package is good without any damage. but the issue is with the earphones. the left earbud is producing static noise and the sound is low compared to right side. it's not like it started after a few days or months. it started on same day as i received the order and just a few minutes after i started using. i don't know if everyone is facing this issue (saw similar comments on youtube and reviews) but this is causing very bad hearing experience. i assume it may be due to driver issue or wiring in left side. request to please take note of this feedback for both buyers and the boat companyread more;

wire earphones, also known as wired earphones or headphones, are a popular choice for many people due to their affordability, reliability, and compatibility with various devices. here are some key aspects to consider when evaluating wire earphones:1. sound quality: the sound quality of wire earphones can vary depending on the brand and price range. generally, they offer good audio performance with clear and balanced sound reproduction. higher-end models may provide enhanced bass response and better overall audio fidelity.2. comfort and fit: the comfort and fit of wire earphones are subjective and depend on individual preferences. some earphone models come with different sizes of ear tips or additional accessories to ensure a secure and comfortable fit. it's important to find a pair that suits your ears well to minimize discomfort during extended use.3. durability: wire earphones are generally more durable compared to their wireless counterparts since they don't have delicate electronic components like batteries or bluetooth modules. however, the quality of materials used and build construction can still affect their longevity. look for earphones with reinforced cables and sturdy connectors to ensure they can withstand daily wear and tear.4. noise isolation: some wire earphones offer passive noise isolation by creating a seal in the ear canal, blocking out external sounds. this can enhance your listening experience, especially in noisy environments. keep in mind that the level of noise isolation can vary between models.5. connectivity: wire earphones typically use a 3.5mm audio jack, making them compatible with a wide range of devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and audio players. however, it's important to check if your device still has a 3.5mm audio jack, as some newer smartphones have transitioned to wireless or usb-c audio connections.when choosing wire earphones, it's recommended to read customer reviews, compare different models, and consider your personal preferences and budget.read more;

i am beyond disappointed with my recent purchase of wireless bluetooth headphones from amazon. from the moment i received the product, it has been nothing but a headache. the headphones are completely defective – the bluetooth feature does not work at all. i tried connecting them to multiple phones, including different brands and models, but the headphones simply refuse to pair. it’s clear that the product is faulty, and no amount of troubleshooting has made a difference.when i reached out to the seller for assistance, their response was utterly unhelpful. they provided no useful solutions or support, and it felt like they were just brushing me off. i then tried to initiate a return and refund through amazon, only to find out that it’s not possible. how is this even acceptable? i paid for a product that doesn’t function as advertised, and now i’m stuck with it. it’s incredibly frustrating to feel like i’ve been scammed out of my money.to make matters worse, amazon’s customer service was no help either. they were unable to resolve the issue and offered no real solution. it’s shocking that a platform as large as amazon would allow such poor-quality products to be sold and then fail to support customers when things go wrong. the entire experience has left me feeling cheated and helpless.this purchase has been a total waste of time and money. the headphones are useless, the seller is unresponsive, and amazon’s customer service is ineffective. i regret ever buying this product and will definitely think twice before making another purchase on amazon. the lack of accountability from both the seller and amazon is unacceptable.i would strongly advise others to avoid this seller and be cautious when shopping on amazon. there’s no guarantee that you’ll receive a functional product, and if something goes wrong, you might be left with no recourse. save yourself the frustration and shop elsewhere. this experience has been a complete disaster, and i will never recommend this seller or rely on amazon for a resolution again.read more;

i'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment i experienced with the noise two wirless. these headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.let's start with the build quality. imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. they weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.now, i'm a reasonable person. accidents happen. so, i contacted noise support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. what i got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. they dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).so, here i am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. the audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. my advice? steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.for those seeking a more constructive alternative:do your research! read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.prioritize build quality. look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.understand the warranty terms thoroughly. don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.read more;

lost 2 different pairs of in-ear tws earphones (thankfully cheaper ones) so i decided to buy something large and harder to lose (lol). it was between this and the bose qc45 for me. my primary headphones for 8 years now are the audio technica ath-m50x which are a solid pair of wired neutral headphones, so i'll use those as a reference for audio quality.short read: why i picked this over the bose qc45 - sounds marginally better overall (with loads of room in the low end for those who like heavy bass), equally comfortable, better battery life, better app/customisability, and also a bit more discreet. i don't want people knowing i'm carrying around pricey headphones so i'd rather have a pair of plain looking sonys than a bose pair that screams expensive. also, the carrying case is actually pretty great and protects these well. i wear these headphones everywhere, even at the gym.- amazing battery: ldac + dsee extreme on gives me a full week of use with 2-3 hours of use per day, at around 60-70% volume. nice to not have to worry about charging these all the time (uses usb-c).- audio: super weird out of the box- very boomy and muddy low-mids. i eqd this and it went from sounding like an average set to an incredible one. it's just a bit bizarre to me that they'd hamstring this pair so severely out of the box when they're capable of so much more.it has great frequency response and articulation, you'll hear tons of detail once it is set up right, so credit to the drivers they're using. i'm including an eq preset for your reference, which should be good for blues, jazz, folk, country, and classical (anything with nice vocals). compared to the m50x, they have much better bass so anyone into edm will like this set as well.- comfort: they're wonderfully comfortable. super light, doesn't clamp your head or ears, and you can wear them for hours. the cushions are soft and don't hurt your ears. orders of magnitude more comfortable than my m50x, and easily the best other than the bose qc line. you'll forget you're wearing them, they're that neat.- anc: they completely block out low hums and noises coming from fans, acs, and in-flight rumble, even with no music playing. makes sense since they seem to be designed primarily as travel/commute headphones. voices and other sounds can still kinda be heard but are drowned out if you're listening to music at anything above 30-40% volume. i don't think it's meant to block out these sounds, so i'm not particular about it. i can sit through an entire flight and hear nothing, which by itself is completely worth it to me.- multipoint: works as advertised, i was able to use it fine with my samsung galaxy phone and macbook pro upon testing. i don't use this feature though since i prefer ldac and that is only possible with multi-point off. however if mp is useful for you, know that it works pretty seamlessly.conclusion: if you can afford these headphones, i would easily recommend them to you. they sound genuinely amazing for a wireless closed back pair, are very customisable, comfortable, and the battery lasts for days, literally. the anc is best-in-class and made for frequent travelers. it's one of those things that will last you years and years of use if you look after them. they also go on sale quite frequently, so wait for one before you buy (i got it for inr ~15,500). it's rare that i spend this much on a luxury item and still consider it a bargain. cheers.read more; i've lost 2 different pairs of in-ear tws earphones (thankfully cheaper ones) so i decided to buy

it's rare that i spend this much on a luxury item and still consider it a bargain. cheers.; i have been using these industry leading headphones by sony, colour midnight blue, and trust me i find them worth every penny spent. yes, i agree these headphones are highly expensive, some may say you can purchase apple airpods, boss, sennheiser, and other audio equipment options, but trust me nothing beats these bad boys.i am not a tech reviewer, but since being a musician, a music connoisseur myself and a huge fanatic of accessories such as headphones, earphones and smart gadgets, i can tell, these headphones are a revolution to the sound industry. i'll be quoting every pros and cons that i've personally come across and might help a few of you who decide to purchase this beauty.pros:1. active noise cancellation (anc): let's talk about people who love listening to their music without any external interference while working, walking, running, working out, during a flight, or any other mode where they'd use them, anc is a boon. switch to anc, you'll have the minimum of the minimum noise entering your ears. only sounds close to you can reach at a very low level, else wise, you won't feel a thing in your ear. be prepared for some bashing from your parents when they scream your name on top of their voices, and you've got that anc kicked in.2. 3 ambience sound control (asc) on: apart from the anc, there are two more features that these bad boys offer.  asc when active gives you a chance to listen to your surroundings at a certain level where you can be aware of people speaking, birds chirping, children hauling in the park, and other sounds. this feature enables one to understand the surrounding noises and doesn't feel isolated.3. ambience sound control (asc) off: when asc is disabled or switched off, you can listen to your surrounding voices in a much denser state, ie. much more clearly in comparison to when the asc is enabled. this feature is much similar to the asc on, just a slight difference of pitch and volume of the surrounding entering your ears.4. head phones connect by sony: let's talk about the main functioning unit of these headphones, the app provided by sony under the name of head phones connect. you can download it from the app store if you are an iphone user just like me, as well as from the play store for android users.this app is highly functional as well as quite intact providing a list of various functions such as adaptive sound control which is highly recommended to lazy people just like me. once all set up, the app detects your actions and locations frequently, and switches the headphones settings automatically.in addition, if you are a daily user of these headphones just like me, the app tracks your daily attributes such as at what certain volume do you like listening you music, which mode do you mostly use, which location do you travel, and then adjusts the headphones as per your choice.one feature which at first startled me a lot but i really got impressed by it which is the speak-to-chat feature. it's always annoying to either pull your phone out of your pocket and pause the music or to just pull off your headsets every time you need to talk to someone. this feature enables your headphones to pause automatically the instant you start speaking, and shall remain pause for about 20 secs and resume on their own if they do not detect any speech.for better sound quality, the app detects the size and shape of your ear through these headphones. this enables the device to perform better with distinct users.5. motion gestures: the right ear piece of the headphones has all the motion gestures such as taps for music pause/play, attend a call, play next/previous song and remove the headsets and the song pauses. these controls are highly helpful and can be easily learnt through the guide book provided, hence i won't dive deeper into it.6. number of devices that can be paired at once: these headphones provide an option of connecting two devices simultaneously. you can connect these headphones to almost every device that has a latest and updated version of bluetooth/nfc. devices that i've paired them with are iphone, macbook, hp laptop, and android phones.7. what's in the box: the box comes with an impressive in-shape carrying case to carry these bad boys where ever you go. also they include a c-type data cable for charging, 3.5mm jack cable which is quite long (haven't measured it honestly, but it is as long as a regular data cable), and a dual port 3.5mm jack converter, which so far i haven't tested.8. battery life: well i must say that i am quite impressed with the battery backup these headphones provide. this device completely charges within 3 hours and trust me with an on/off mode of playing music regularly, the battery stays up till 4-5 days, which is i bet a highly impressive feature which probably no other company audio equipment in this range might have.9. voice assist functions: these headphones can be connected to google assistant, siri and alexa and perform really well.10. easy access keys: the headphones are enable with two easy access keys on the left earphone. the custom key toggles between the 3 modes that i've already mentioned above which are guided by the in-built assistant voice. the power key pressed long enough, turns on/off the device and pressed once, the in-built assist provides you with the current % of the battery left.11. comfort: i should had talked about it earlier, but never mind. with no questions asked these headphones are highly comfortable, the cushion provided is the softest pad your ears can get. since i am regular spectacle user, i find it hard with headphones imposing excessive pressure over the ears, making it a painful experience, but these headphones give a feather touch to your ears, even if you are specy or even while wearing a face mask. these go good with everything.12. battery saver: these headphones tend to power-off on their own if not in use for more than a minute which is a highly power efficient feature added by sony to the device.cons:1. if you are into running or any sort of longer workouts, be prepared for sweaty ears. since the cushions on these headphones completely cover you ears, creating a vacuum sort of environment, no air flows in and out, and the sweat starts dripping down from the earphones, which i must state doesn't affect them at all, only can be slightly irritating sometimes.2. anc can be difficult to be kept enabled every time since it reduces the environment sounds to almost negligible, which can be dangerous while running or walking at a buss street. be very careful while using this feature. probably it is made for environments such as while travelling in a bus or a flight, and seems suitable for these environments.3. since these headphones can be simultaneously be connected to two devices at once, which is a boon, but is also a slight problem in disguise. imagine your headphones are connected with your laptop as well as you phone. you are attending an important zoom call while on your laptop and the headphones are in action, your phone starts to ring, now abruptly you'll start hearing you phones ringtone, and the device gets a little startled to which device shall be entertained. i've personally faced this, but i tend not to connect them to two devices at once.ps: one highly important thing is, you won't get an experience of the sound through reading review or watching youtube videos. you might get a fair image of weather to invest in them or not, but you'll only get the sound experience when you'll listen the music through these bad boys.read more; i have been using these industry leading headphones by sony, colour midnight blue,

flight, or any other mode where they'd use them, anc is a boon. switch to anc, you'll have the minimum of the minimum noise entering your ears. only sounds close to you can reach at a very low level, else wise, you won't feel a thing in your ear. be prepared for some bashing from your parents when they scream your name on top of their voices, and you've got that anc kicked in.2. 3 ambience sound control (asc) on: apart from the anc, there are two more features that these bad boys offer.  asc when active gives you a chance to listen to your surroundings at a certain level where you can be aware of people speaking, birds chirping, children hauling in the park, and other sounds. this feature enables one to understand the surrounding noises and doesn't feel isolated.3. ambience sound control (asc) off: when asc is disabled or switched off, you can listen to your surrounding voices in a much denser state, ie. much more clearly in comparison to when the asc is enabled. this feature is much similar to the asc on, just a slight difference of pitch and volume of the surrounding entering your ears.4. head phones connect by sony: let's talk about the main functioning unit of these headphones, the app provided by sony under the name of head phones connect. you can download it from the app store if you are an iphone user just like me, as well as from the play store for android users.this app is highly functional as well as quite intact providing a list of various functions such as adaptive sound control which is highly recommended to lazy people just like me. once all set up, the app detects your actions and locations frequently, and switches the headphones settings automatically.in addition, if you are a daily user of these headphones just like me, the app tracks your daily attributes such as at what certain volume do you like listening you music, which mode do you mostly use, which location do you travel, and then adjusts the headphones as per your choice.one feature which at first startled me a lot but i really got impressed by it which is the speak-to-chat feature. it's always annoying to either pull your phone out of your pocket and pause the music or to just pull off your headsets every time you need to talk to someone. this feature enables your headphones to pause automatically the instant you start speaking, and shall remain pause for about 20 secs and resume on their own if they do not detect any speech.for better sound quality, the app detects the size and shape of your ear through these headphones. this enables the device to perform better with distinct users.5. motion gestures: the right ear piece of the headphones has all the motion gestures such as taps for music pause/play, attend a call, play next/previous song and remove the headsets and the song pauses. these controls are highly helpful and can be easily learnt through the guide book provided, hence i won't dive deeper into it.6. number of devices that can be paired at once: these headphones provide an option of connecting two devices simultaneously. you can connect these headphones to almost every device that has a latest and updated version of bluetooth/nfc. devices that i've paired them with are iphone, macbook, hp laptop, and android phones.7. what's in the box: the box comes with an impressive in-shape carrying case to carry these bad boys where ever you go. also they include a c-type data cable for charging, 3.5mm jack cable which is quite long (haven't measured it honestly, but it is as long as a regular data cable), and a dual port 3.5mm jack converter, which so far i haven't tested.8. battery life: well i must say that i am quite impressed with the battery backup these headphones provide. this device completely charges within 3 hours and trust me with an on/off mode of playing music regularly, the battery stays up till 4-5 days, which is i bet a highly impressive feature which probably no other company audio equipment in this range might have.9. voice assist functions: these headphones can be connected to google assistant, siri and alexa and perform really well.10. easy access keys: the headphones are enable with two easy access keys on the left earphone. the custom key toggles between the 3 modes that i've already mentioned above which are guided by the in-built assistant voice. the power key pressed long enough, turns on/off the device and pressed once, the in-built assist provides you with the current % of the battery left.11. comfort: i should had talked about it earlier, but never mind. with no questions asked these headphones are highly comfortable, the cushion provided is the softest pad your ears can get. since i am regular spectacle user, i find it hard with headphones imposing excessive pressure over the ears, making it a painful experience, but these headphones give a feather touch to your ears, even if you are specy or even while wearing a face mask. these go good with everything.12. battery saver: these headphones tend to power-off on their own if not in use for more than a minute which is a highly power efficient feature added by sony to the device.cons:1. if you are into running or any sort of longer workouts, be prepared for sweaty ears. since the cushions on these headphones completely cover you ears, creating a vacuum sort of environment, no air flows in and out, and the sweat starts dripping down from the earphones, which i must state doesn't affect them at all, only can be slightly irritating sometimes.2. anc can be difficult to be kept enabled every time since it reduces the environment sounds to almost negligible, which can be dangerous while running or walking at a buss street. be very careful while using this feature. probably it is made for environments such as while travelling in a bus or a flight, and seems suitable for these environments.3. since these headphones can be simultaneously be connected to two devices at once, which is a boon, but is also a slight problem in disguise. imagine your headphones are connected with your laptop as well as you phone. you are attending an important zoom call while on your laptop and the headphones are in action, your phone starts to ring, now abruptly you'll start hearing you phones ringtone, and the device gets a little startled to which device shall be entertained. i've personally faced this, but i tend not to connect them to two devices at once.ps: one highly important thing is, you won't get an experience of the sound through reading review or watching youtube videos. you might get a fair image of weather to invest in them or not, but you'll only get the sound experience when you'll listen the music through these bad boys.; good fit and finish. excellent sound signature, anc works like a charm.

sound signature, anc works like a charm. multi-point feature adds convenience.; with cable they don't use any battery and of course the sony headphone app with it's equalizer doesn't work then either. i've tried them with and without a dac (ifi) and they really have a lot of well sounding to deliver to it's user - especially with hi-res lossless and atmos track. they are easily driven when connected to a computer and the sound was amazing. breathtaking. i couldn't believe what i was experiencing. finding nuances in songs i never have heard before. yes, bluetooth is great but with the cable they really come alive. at least imho. as with my xm4 in ear, the bluetooth connection works great and with sony headphones app (tried on iphone and ipad) where you can fine tune the equalizer to your liking. some said that they are bass heavy, but imho i wouldn't say that. it's there but not overtaking as some reviewers have stated. rather quite neutral. left to test is the noise cancelling when outside so i can't say anything about that yet - but i imagine it's like my in ear xm4 and those take away engine sound, people talking and so on. if you decide to get these i don't think you will be anything but pleased. and for us100 less than the xm5 it's just great. and these head phone cups folds which the xm5 don't... and i have a boose that are like that and it isn't great - aren't things supposed to get better and more innovative? what i mean is: great to not feel like being strangled when you take them off and let them rest on your neck. now i have over ear headphones that hopefully will last as long as my old ones: 20+ years... and with the flexibiity to use bluetooth as well. these are my only over ear from now on. i hope this ""review"" is of some usefulness for you. cheers!read more; with cable they don't use any battery and of course the sony headphone app with it's equalizer doesn't work then either. i've tried them with and without a dac (ifi) and they

flojera leer, de entrada te digo que esto vale cada centavo, no lo dudes ni esperes, rompe el cochinito porque te lo estás perdiendo.ahora si para los que dudan de dios:hace 3 años adquirí los mdr-xb950n1, mejor conocidos como los sony extra bass. sin duda fueron una compra demasiado buena, pasé de unos skullcandy hesh 2 a los extra bass y vaya que la diferencia es muy considerable.ahora, 3 años después decidí hacer un ""upgrade"", yo me dedico a la música, soy estudiante de la materia y me dedico al audio, la verdad es que no puedo llevarme mis audífonos de estudio fuera de casa, necesitaba unos que realmente ofrecieran buena calidad, portabilidad y facilidad de uso con mis aplicaciones. encontré estos después de hacer un par de búsquedas en internet, los comparé con varias opciones y al final me decidí por comprarlos.en primera debo decir que he quedado impresionado por la tecnología que traen estos audífonos. puedes personalizar el audio acorde a tu oreja, así es, a la forma de tu oreja, sony te pide que tomes un par de fotos para que se puedan analizar y proveer mejor experiencia, nunca en mi vida había visto algo así.desde que los abres se denota un producto bastante premium y que vale el dinero que se paga por él, ya que de hecho no es nada barato.la experiencia de abrirlo es excelente, pero es cuando bajas la aplicación que empiezas a ver lo brutal de estas máquinas. de adelanto estos audífonos ya vienen con carga máxima, o al menos así fue en mi caso, no te pide que los cargues ni nada, funcionan desde que los sacas de la caja. son extremadamente cómodos y si eres miope como yo y usas fierros para ver, estos audífonos no te van a incomodar en ningún momento.no es que quiera advertir, sino más bien dar aviso de que por defecto los audífonos se oyen un poco flojos, el sonido está un poco saturado, y si te gusta escuchar música como el heavy metal o música clásica te quedas pasmado, no se oyen para nada como los extra bass que al salir de la caja otorgan un sonido fino y bien configurado. estos no, pero entiendo por qué lo hacen, ya que como mencioné, la experiencia de verdad comienza cuando bajas la aplicación que tiene como mil opciones de configuración y optimización de sonido, así que prepárate para estar ahí unos 25 minutos de tu vida, que sin duda alguna por supuesto, lo valen.una vez que has pasado las optimizaciones, toca jugar con el ecualizador, yo recomiendo configuración 400: 1 1k: 3 2.5k: 7 6.3k: 8 16k: 5 clear bass: +5 o +7 para escuchar heavy metal y música clásica, aunque si eres fan de los medios tal vez quieras mover un poco más, pero como dije, esto es libre y sony te prevé todas las herramientas para que esto quede sabroso.ya con todo listo, toca escuchar música, y ahí es cuando te da el golpe. sabía que habría una diferencia entre los extra bass que tengo y los m4 que son estos, pero no sabía que realmente se fuera a notar tanto. estos no son audífonos, son interfaces de audio andantes, además, sony te regala una prueba gratis en cualquier servicio de restringe que contenga su servicio sony audio 3d, yo escogí tidal, pero también puedes escoger otros 3 más, ahí aparece la opción.de verdad que escuchar música en formato de alta calidad como es el flac que te ofrece tidal es algo maravilloso, inclusive después de varios años escuchando lo mismo, logré notar varios elementos musicales extras que antes ni sabía que existían en la canción, ahí es cuando te vas para atrás, es como por fin escuchar las cosas sin filtro. también recomiendo el formato ""loss-less"" de apple music en caso de que sean usuarios de iphone o solo para que tengan una tercera opción. sea cual sea el servicio que escojan, se oye increíble, pero sin duda combinado con formatos de baja compresión esto se vuelve místico.claro que esto no es tan plano como unos audífonos de estudio, pero sin duda la experiencia se acerca bastante.en conclusión, estos audífonos realmente son un producto bastante premium, te otorgan no solo alta calidad de audio, sino una experiencia tecnológica muy innovadora, además vienen con su porta audiófonos y cables correspondientes, son muy cómodos y portables. los recomiendo al 100% no duden en adquirirlo para nada.read more; review completo como consumidor y profesional dedicado al audio, si te da flojera leer, de entrada te digo que esto vale cada centavo, no lo dudes ni

hey there, i've been using these headphones regularly for the past 6 months now, and so lemme tell you about everything which i've discovered till now...so first of all, this is probably not the best choice for bass lovers, this won't provide you with any head shaking bass, but bass is punchy and kicks in right when it has to...the connectivity is great, but can trouble you sometimes if you use them wirelessly for meetings, the sound quality is pretty awesome, deep clarity about the notes, perfect lows and highs, just lacks a bit in the mids, but you won't even notice that...gives you one of the best listening experience in all types of genres...the anc is one of the things i didn't like about it, when you turn on the anc, a very little amount of sound,mostly like fans is blocked from outside, and the bass gets affected too when anc is on, but as soon as you put these headphones on, it already blocks most of the outside noise, and when you play music with anc off, you still won't be able to hear a thing from outside which is a rare thing...the best part about this is indeed the battery life, obviously lasts upto 25-30 hours, and gets charged to around 75% in just 15 mins, impressive!talking about the comfort, they are lightweight, have perfect clamping force, and have pretty soft earpads which cover all your ear and seals it, and so there is no soundleak as well...you can also change the sound according to oyu using their app...finally putting everything together, value for the money if you listen to different genres and ofc if you are a music lover...satisfied with the purchase and performance tho...trust me sennheiser won't upset you :)read more;

are the best headphones from sony. previously i used sony headphones but they're entry-level headphones.  i also used headphones from other brands like sennheiser, one audio and jbl but all of them are entry-level headphones. this is the first time i bought high-end headphones and i trust sony. you can't go wrong with sony as per my experience. coming to the headphones, i already knew that these were best. however, i researched thoroughly on youtube and read many articles for almost 3 months before buying these. i want to get the best value for the price. these headphones are costly and i don't want to go wrong with my purchase decision.build quality: these are made of high-quality plastic and feel lightweight and comfortable to wear for longer durations. the only thing is, that the headband is thin and hurts a little on my head after wearing it for a few hours. just move or adjust it a little and i'm good to go for another hour.sound quality: it's sony, no need to brag about sound quality. sony is known for sound clarity. every small musical instrument is heard in great detail. i can't forget my first experience of listening to music using these headphones. i'm blown away by the details and the clarity of sound.battery life: it is mentioned 30 hours. seems to be true. headphones will easily last up to two days of mixed usage.noise cancellation (n.c.): these headphones are my first experience with noise cancellation. when nc is turned on, it is silent. zero noise. but after a few days,  i realised that i could still hear voices from other people when they were shouting or talking loudly. it's good not to completely block all sound.update on n.c.:i want to address one thing people who are saying that nc is not good. i think they feel like that because of the adaptive nc feature in the sony headphones app. due to this feature, the level of noise cancelling is adjusted automatically according to the surroundings. i know it doesn't work 100% accurately every time. it works sort of 70 - 80 % accurately depending on the surroundings. that's why some people complain that nc is not completely silent or perfect. some are complaining there is no option to disable the adaptive nc feature. it is available in the sony headphones app after the latest update. we can also manually disable the adaptive nc of headphones using the app. i mentioned these details because some people may not be aware of these features available in the headphones app.note: when nc is turned on, a sound pressure is created between ears and headphones. so there is a vacuum-like seal between ears and headphones and it blocks external sound. i'm not sure how nc works. this is the first time for me experienced noise cancellation. it was a shock and a surprise feeling when nc was on. my brother got scared due to this effect. i got used to it now. check the sony manual regarding the safety of nc. in the sony headphones connect app, there is a safe listening setting. please follow it and you don't need to worry about your ears getting damaged due to headphones. i have attached screenshots of the same. please check.final verdict: i can say that these headphones are the best consumer headphones. audiophile headphones are different that's why i mentioned them as the best consumer headphones. most people who use them will love them.read more; these are the best

always of the belief that they have the best music reproduction with lossless audio from apps like apple music. was seriously wanting to try the xms when the xm4 was launched but wasn’t happy with the reviews of mic quality as i generally take calls for more than 7 hours on my work days. but when xm5s came in was tempted to try them after the reviews paying more details on the improved mic quality. i wanted to give it a try and tried the music when i was in france in a store, but the sound quality was very poor since the store let me use it only with their wired audio source and said no to try with my phone. back in india i tried again once in a store using my phone and apple music and boy o boy i was proved wrong!!! i was simply blown over on how the headphones were clear with the spatial audio even with the default eq setting. i’m not a bass heavy person but rather love the different tones and this is a pro quality one in that. with the anc microphones it was even a blessing that the call trials(both with ms teams and phone) i did were fantastic. decided to grab this and ordered in amazon when it was available for around 28k net with cashback and i would say this is the best investment i had made. the dual connectivity, monstrous battery back up, anc combined with the best mic makes it a great headphone one can ever have. the size and case as most say as negative isn’t a problem at all. the build also is good and this is a keeper. if you are not worried about the budget and need a headphone that u can use for both work(calls) and music blindly go for this.. 👍🏻read

it is disappointing.build and design: i had used these headphones for more than week and i would say device is very comfortable for longer use ( watching movies) , quite light weight , controls are easy to use, touch response is fast with almost no delay.audio: well i am not used to over the ears devices so i cant compare to others but its great overall. bit bassy for my liking and little less bright u can say but it can be easily fixed by eq. so no problems there ( may be brand had tuned it for more neutral profile) .after eq tuning these are mostly excellent for songs , movies podcast etc.also audio quality depends upon you device too. as i tested it on low end mobile and high end devices, u can observe difference.noise cancellation:  i bought these for work at home , typically coding, study research papers , as people can get really vocal and for analysing complex articles you need silence. as per all reviews these are one of the best but you need to keep your expectation realistic. you can easily hear person talking at moderate volume in same room( reduce by a bit ) or even to next room if someone it talking loud or moderately loud.but if in next room people are talking a moderately low volume you wont hear them same is for tv, at high volume you will definitly hear it.( you can play some white noise or music than you minimise other noise.)what more to consider: these cut other background noise like of ac ( almost completely ) , birds, other typical noises. it can get little uncomfortable( unnatural silence 😂) for some in begining. you also hear people because it cut other backgroud noise so much that even little things are more highlighted.for other: if you are buying these for listening music and watching movies while travel it will cut every thing while playing music or movies. maybe these are designed for this purpose.pass though mode: as per my opinion its great , almost natural with no delay,battery i didnt tested extensively that how much time it can go but i feel more than sufficient  easily last for  couple of days  if using 5-6 hours a day, charging is also fast so no worries there.biggest bummer for me. its no surprise that there is no dolby atmos support. i think for this price it should be there, as sony 360 audio is not supported at all platforms n very less content is available. so for spatial audio doby should had been there. i had used other product with dolby it makes huge impact.read more; 4 star rating just for bad packing from seller as there are no packing material on the box. seller

periquitos australianos e com o nc ativado ainda da pra escutar o piado deles, porém se vc colocar uma música de fundo ai desaparece todos os sons ao redor e vc fica isolado.qualidade de som nas músicas é excelente, porém tenho um astro a40 que uso no playstation e prefiro o som do astro com a mixamp tanto pra músicas como filmes e séries.em relação ao conforto achei confortável, dá pra usar por bastante tempo, porém achei o espaço para orelhas muito raso, as orelhas encostam e é oq faz ter que dar umas pausas, oq por exemplo não ocorre com o astro a40 que o espaço é bem maior, mais confortável, a orelha não encosta e daria pra ficar o dia inteiro com ele, nesse quesito também gostaria de citar o anker life q30 que era o headphone que usava antes desse, acho o anker mais confórtável, embora perca no nc e qualidade sonora.por fim o investimento foi grande, mais nosso problema é a taxação e o real que não vale nada comparado com o dólar, espero que o headphone dure muito tempo, pois realizei a compra por conta do meu anker life q30 com 1 ano e meio de uso parou de funcionar o noise cancel e descascou todo e abriu a parte da espuma, levando em conta que o anker

within reach of your budget or a bit of a stretch more, you would not regret the purchase afterwards. still have not gone through all the features, functions, and app but based just based off the sound alone i am extremely satisfied; sony wh-1000xm5 wireless industry leading noise cancelling headphones with auto noise cancelling optimizer, crystal clear hands-free calling, and alexa voice control, blackwell i finally felt time to upgrade my headphones. i've been using the old boss quiet comfort 3's.  quite dated i know. but it lasted me a very long time.  it's done well for menow after much time passed i finally picked up this sony xm5.my comparison is with that old headphone.  perhaps not the best apples to apples fairness.  i don't look for studio reference flat sound with these . i look daily music listening whilst working. something to work out with.  something that has good enough clarity in highs and deep bass for pop music.  my high fi lilistening is done by wired headphones which is a total other category of audiophile gear.for these i need superb noise cancelling that is superior to bose .  i need exciting lively bass tightness and crispy highs without harshness.  a good mic for conference calls.  an ambient mode to use when jogging.this sony xm5 delivers and tldr i can easily replace my bose qm3 with these.1. sound .  first thing i noticed immediately... this has ultra tight bass .  bass is as deep as you want it. and can be set to create a super tight quick reacting bass.  very satisfying in all musical genres.  wayyy exceeds bose bass performance which imo was its weakest point .  by default thigh highs are flat and lifeless but after a super quick eqing session i got it to my preferred listening and it sounds amazing.  i'm very happy with the sound. it feels smooth and unfatiguing when i want it... and then it can be eq'd to be clinically sharp but not harsh.... whenever you feel like it.  it is hands down a huge step above bose.2. noise cancelling.  tldr?  huge upgrade over bose qc3.  it's dead quiet.  it is scare silent actually... really eerie.  i love this because i turn it on and just use it as a way to work i'm office without the hum of the hvac system.3. ambient mode.  the sony app allows you to adjust the levels to satisfy how much exterior sound to leak into your headphones. i like this.  it also allows you to setup detection mode to allow you to swap to ambient mode automatically when you talk and have conversations.... music stops.  after 15 seconds the ambient mode reverts back to noise reduction mode and resumes music.  really handy.  love it.3. mic for conference calls.  absolutely outstanding without premature cutting off of voice which is a common issue with these headphone mics... bose suffered from this greatly.  this is crystal clear mic and no issues using this in professional conference calls.4.  tap controls.. very simple straight forward. uses a swipe or tap setup on the right ear.  the entire right side ear flat side is a drawing board .  large surface area makes for superbly reliable gestures that make it consistent and easy to control.  swiping up and down is volume.  swiping fwd or back is tracks.  double tapping pause and resumes.  theres no way to adjust the gesture actions on the app. .nor is there a way to make the left side become gesture side in case you prefer left side .... it's only right side.  to me it is not a show stopper but perhaps for others it could be. the only other buttons is the anc button to toggle noise cancelling mode and ambient mode.  you can program double or triple clicking of the button to launch spotify or other music apps but i only use double tap for spotify.  the other button is on/off / pairing.  this isn't customizable.  i would have liked to see a bit more customizable actions here but it's ok... sometimes it's better to have more simplicity.  oh by the way you can turn off the tap swipe gestures entirely  case you find this to be annoying with accidental taps especially when you're wearing the headphones laying down5. automatic modes.  based on location , you can have your phone help detect location and automatically set your profile for you. example if you're working , set noise cancelling ... or if it detects jogging then setup ambient mode . etc... handy but not something i would use.  i like to be in control.6. comfort.  this is a really light weight product. very comfortable. wraps fully account ear.  theres no issue with long wear time because it's so light and feels great.  the vinyl material wraps the  foam and doesn't feel sweaty .  you can replace this with other materials ( third party).  lots out there.  i really wished there are larger labelling of l and r to quickly visually see which side is right.  it's a tiny little r on the inside of the headphone head piece ... the bose had a huge r and l on the inside of the headphone ear foam so it's hidden front he outside but still stealthy.  i get that sonys design for these headphones are minimalist stealthy look but the r and l could've been larger and still stealthy.7. this uses usbc. and charges quick and lasts a long time.  whilst not as long as my bose,  it's long enough for me to be reliable to last me entire day and more. no problem. i have no issues here.  it's fantastic.8. the sony connect app is clean and easy to use.  it's what unlocks the sony headphones to another level.  much better than bose software.  you need it for eq and various profiles .  without it you're going to miss out.so to conclude i'm gonna give it huge 5 star rating. rare for me.  it's a fantastic device.  huge upgrade from my bose qc3.  really happy with this so far.  and what made it a great buy from me is i've found it in amazon warehouse open box pricing.  you can't beat that .hope this helpsread more; sony wh-1000xm5 wireless industry leading noise cancelling headphones with auto noise cancelling

satisfying in all musical genres.  wayyy exceeds bose bass performance which imo was its weakest point .  by default thigh highs are flat and lifeless but after a super quick eqing session i got it to my preferred listening and it sounds amazing.  i'm very happy with the sound. it feels smooth and unfatiguing when i want it... and then it can be eq'd to be clinically sharp but not harsh.... whenever you feel like it.  it is hands down a huge step above bose.2. noise cancelling.  tldr?  huge upgrade over bose qc3.  it's dead quiet.  it is scare silent actually... really eerie.  i love this because i turn it on and just use it as a way to work i'm office without the hum of the hvac system.3. ambient mode.  the sony app allows you to adjust the levels to satisfy how much exterior sound to leak into your headphones. i like this.  it also allows you to setup detection mode to allow you to swap to ambient mode automatically when you talk and have conversations.... music stops.  after 15 seconds the ambient mode reverts back to noise reduction mode and resumes music.  really handy.  love it.3. mic for conference calls.  absolutely outstanding without premature cutting off of voice which is a common issue with these headphone mics... bose suffered from this greatly.  this is crystal clear mic and no issues using this in professional conference calls.4.  tap controls.. very simple straight forward. uses a swipe or tap setup on the right ear.  the entire right side ear flat side is a drawing board .  large surface area makes for superbly reliable gestures that make it consistent and easy to control.  swiping up and down is volume.  swiping fwd or back is tracks.  double tapping pause and resumes.  theres no way to adjust the gesture actions on the app. .nor is there a way to make the left side become gesture side in case you prefer left side .... it's only right side.  to me it is not a show stopper but perhaps for others it could be. the only other buttons is the anc button to toggle noise cancelling mode and ambient mode.  you can program double or triple clicking of the button to launch spotify or other music apps but i only use double tap for spotify.  the other button is on/off / pairing.  this isn't customizable.  i would have liked to see a bit more customizable actions here but it's ok... sometimes it's better to have more simplicity.  oh by the way you can turn off the tap swipe gestures entirely  case you find this to be annoying with accidental taps especially when you're wearing the headphones laying down5. automatic modes.  based on location , you can have your phone help detect location and automatically set your profile for you. example if you're working , set noise cancelling ... or if it detects jogging then setup ambient mode . etc... handy but not something i would use.  i like to be in control.6. comfort.  this is a really light weight product. very comfortable. wraps fully account ear.  theres no issue with long wear time because it's so light and feels great.  the vinyl material wraps the  foam and doesn't feel sweaty .  you can replace this with other materials ( third party).  lots out there.  i really wished there are larger labelling of l and r to quickly visually see which side is right.  it's a tiny little r on the inside of the headphone head piece ... the bose had a huge r and l on the inside of the headphone ear foam so it's hidden front he outside but still stealthy.  i get that sonys design for these headphones are minimalist stealthy look but the r and l could've been larger and still stealthy.7. this uses usbc. and charges quick and lasts a long time.  whilst not as long as my bose,  it's long enough for me to be reliable to last me entire day and more. no problem. i have no issues here.  it's fantastic.8. the sony connect app is clean and easy to use.  it's what unlocks the sony headphones to another level.  much better than bose software.  you need it for eq and various profiles .  without it you're going to miss out.so to conclude i'm gonna give it huge 5 star rating. rare for me.  it's a fantastic device.  huge upgrade from my bose qc3.  really happy with this so far.  and what made it a great buy from me is i've found it in amazon warehouse open box pricing.  you can't beat that .hope this helps",headphones,7

i have been using various anc headphones for years and i bought these because my airpods pro got spoilt and i forgot my bose quiet control 30s at home while travelling. it looks pretty good with impressive fit and finish. the buttons feel well built yet the headphone is quite light. it did not hurt my ears even after long hours of continuous use.sound quality: i am an audio visual production professional and i felt it sounds quite balanced (for a jbl) in the eq off setting. pump up the volume and it can get pretty loud. the 'super bass' eq mode really pumps up the bass. the bass response is deep with precise attacks and releases, does not sound boomy at all. i like how these headphones sound. the calling quality too is surprisingly good. it cuts most ambient noises coming into the microphone while on a phone call.anc: does the job okay but there are much better anc headphones available in the market. compared to the bose quiet series, the apple airpods pro or even the sony headphones with anc these felt inferior. in my recent travel in an airplane, these headphones started crackling; especially while the airplane was taking off. the filtration of the aircraft engine sound kept varying throughout my three hours of flying.ergonomics: it takes a little while to get used to the position of the buttons. i felt that the anc on-off toggle button should have been placed on the other earpiece of the headphone and not along with the power button or the volume control/play-pause buttons. again, takes a while to get used to this button position. the charging port is on the top side of the right earpiece. thus, you cannot use the headphones while charging them. the wired connection option is definitely a handy option if you want to use them connected to a computer on a table. the wire is a trrs jack and kept playing in mono when connected to a trs only socket.battery backup: very good battery backup so even with a continuous use with anc for approx 6 hours and with about 60% volume on music and multiple phone calls, it just consumed 40% charge.overall verdict: it's a good buy only if you have budget constraints and you're offered hefty discounts. if not then there are far better anc headphones available in the market.read more;

this headphone is a bag of mixed feelings, but let me break down what is good about it and what is missing.on one hand i feel there is a lack of bass when i am listening to pop and upbeat music, but at the same time i works well when i am watching documentaries or doing editing as it enhances the audio by boosting its treble. so if you are a music lover and loves a lot of bass, it is not for you. you can amp up your bass from the device you have paired it to, but it doesn't hit anywhere close to premium bass quality. on the other hand if you watch a lot of content which involves dialogues and documentaries, this is the perfect headphone for you as it gives amazing speech clarity. i would say this is also an editors and gamers headphone, where communication is very important and speeches takes great importance over beats and rhythms. i like that we can swap between ambient aware and noise cancellation, and it's greatest pro is the battery life. this headphone as a very good battery life, you can run it for days without even realizing that you need to charge it. i use it for work, meetings and calls, and also for editing purpose, and i am happy with my purchase, but if i was a sound editor or into audio compositing i think there are better options in the market at the same price.read more;

these headphones are good for the price but there is only one major problem that is comfort...i mean that you will not be able to wear them for long sessions otherwise it's overall a banger considering it's price. the mic is good, i tested the mic on discord and calls...it's pretty well. battery is superb as it's been two days since i they were 100% and now when am writing this review.....it's still at 90%. sound quality is good. gaming is bit of controversial as some might find it good but lemme tell u one thing that the latency is always not good at this price point but these are good for any story mode games and ok ok for competitive games.hope it helps☺️btw i got them for 800 rs.read more;

sound:i wanted something of a neutral sounding headphones.and i say that if you're more of a bass lover this might not meet your expectation butthis headphones are very good neutral sounding headphones means every frequency is well balanced. lows-mids-treblehigh end frequencies are little less compare to other headphones but the sub bass and bass quality is very good.i'm not a fan of more high end frequencies but to some users it might sound less energetic on that area compare to lets say beyerdynamic or audiotechnica headphones.personally i like high end of this headphones because of the balance and not harsh highs , i can listen to it for a long time.and noise cancellation is also good.comfort level:at first these headphones might be little tight on your head and is the reason for noise cancellation also.the cups are comfortable and will cover your whole ears.the headphones will get comfortable to your liking after some time you can adjust the size with slider above the cups.build quality:at this price range i think the build quality is goodheadphones are foldable and light.but the wire is non detachable and cable is heavy so i think i have to take care of it and not be reckless about it.so i don't think these headphones are made for walking and listening typethese are made for sitting in one place and listening type.final verdict:i make music and i heard that most of mixing engineers use this to mix their beats so i ordered iti like this headphones because it met my expectations.at first you might not be able to grasp the sound stage of these headphones because you might not used to these type of headphones.sound quality is good and almost neutral.i am not using these as my headphones for gym and i am not taking it with me when i go outside.it's not like you can't take it outside , the headphones are light weighted but cable is heavy and non detachable that's why.after using it sometime and grasping the sound stage, i can listen in this headphones for hours and pick little details in the songs too.so read this and based on your application you can choose whether to take it or not.note: i saw the pictures online of this headphones and i found that that were two models.one is old one where on back of the cup of headphones,  sennheiser hd 280 pro 64 ohms is writtensecond is new model where only hd 280 pro is writtenso don't get confused with the images shown when you receive these headphones and don't find sennheiser 64 ohms written on back of the cups.cheers!read more;

i got tired of buying cheap headphones that break easily and don't regret paying extra for these at all. i've been frustrated why so many companies try to save a few cents making such thin cords that break in a few months only to lose money replacing them on warranty. this actually has a cord built to last and it's coiled so it's flexible. the cord is a bit short though for my setup so i use a cord extension to make sure it doesn't get tugged and damaged.i'm not an audio professional but the sound quality is amazing to me and a lot more natural sounding. the bass it has feels like having a subwoofer. the frequency response is rated for 8 hz but from my testing at typical listening volume levels it can only noticeably play tones as low as 11 hz, which is still pretty good. it also surprisingly blocks out a lot of outside noise too, about half as much as the hearing protection i use at work.i also love that they're comfortable and so adjustable. i like to pull one side behind my ear while singing so i can hear myself and they still fit to my head perfectly.read more;

surprisingly exceeded my expectations. although i am very disappointed with no proper wired mode, the sound quality drastically decreases if you plug it via 3.5mm to any device. there is no way to switch on the headphone while on wired mode so the in-built amp can activate better sound quality. which is a pity, but ah well. can't have it all, can ya?best bluetooth headphones at 799 for sound and mic quality. and let's not forget comfort. headphone is light on the head, snug fit that doesn't clamp onto your head like it's squeezing your head.although please don't go for these headphones if you expect exceptional clarity, as the bass is so overpowering that it can dampen the the mids and highs a bit.even though i have conveyed many disadvantages about this headphone, there is literally no better bluetooth headphone available at this price under 1000.  even the battery life of this headphones are amazing. so if your budget is 1000 and you want wireless bluetooth headphones and not earphones, then blindly go for these. but if you don't mind going for earphones, then there are many better options available in terms of sound quality.read more;

the noise master buds genuinely surprised me — and in the best way possible. noise partnering with bose for sound tuning really shows in the final product. i honestly didn't expect this level of sound quality from an indian brand in this price range, but the audio clarity and balance are top-notch. the bass feels deep without overpowering, mids are clean, and the highs are crisp. whether you're listening to music or watching a movie, the sound feels immersive and natural.the active noise cancellation (anc) is another highlight — it can cut out a surprising amount of background noise. noise claims up to 49db of noise cancellation, and while i haven't measured it, the performance feels on par with some higher-end earbuds. even in crowded environments, the buds block out most distractions, making them perfect for travel or work.the design is sleek and minimal, with a comfortable fit that doesn't cause ear fatigue even after hours of use. the touch controls are responsive, and i love how you can customize them through the noise audio app.battery life is impressive too — i got close to the claimed 44 hours with the case, and the buds last around 8 hours on a single charge. the dual device pairing feature is super convenient, letting me switch between my laptop and phone without any hassle.overall, the noise master buds feel like a big step forward for indian audio brands. with bose's tuning and solid features like anc, spatial audio, and ldhc support, they easily compete with more expensive options.read more;

i recently purchased the noise master buds from amazon and overall, i'm quite satisfied with the experience. the retro-inspired design is stylish and the earbuds fit comfortably, though they are slightly bulky. sound quality is solid with 12.4mm titanium drivers delivering balanced audio across highs and mids, though treble can get a bit sharp at higher volumes. the active noise cancellation (up to 49db) works impressively well, especially in office and commuting environments. battery life is another strong point, offering up to 50 hours with the case and a quick charge feature that’s super handy. indoor call quality is great, but outdoor performance struggles with background noise. however, the build quality feels a bit plasticky and the case is on the larger side, which doesn’t quite match the premium price tag. considering all this, i find the product slightly overpriced for what it offers, but still a solid choice for everyday use. i’m giving it 4 out of 5 stars.read more;

i'm not an audiophile, or someone who makes/produces music, so i didn't buy these with the intent of using them as ""studio monitors"". i just needed a set of comfortable, over-ear 'phones primarily for home use (not commute) that both look and sound good and don't cost a lot. very casual, regular usage; no professional stuff. and for someone with similar requirements, i would definitely implore them to check these out.i love the design. no complaints wrt the material used. incidentally, i was planning on buying the cheaper k52s because of their all black body, but i decided against it because i prefer the cushioning on this one. the look is great too. these are probably the only pair of headphones that don't make me look crazy.the comfort is decent. lmao i actually forgot that these have no adjustable slider thing and instead have the self-adjusting headband, but either way, it feels okay. the earcups are huge and so would completely engulf anyone's ears. i'm 6', have a relatively large head and ears, so these were actually good for me. none of that sharp pain you get from on-ears.caveat: when you wear these, if your ears are big, especially if they are more ""out"" (basically, protrude outward from your head in a more noticeable way), then they might touch the inside of the cans, which feels... weird, for sure. it doesn't cause like immense discomfort, but it's still weird and does cause some strain after a while because your ears are literally pressing against the inside of the cup. also, after a while, your ears might feel warm too. not hot, just slightly warm.the cord is, yes, very long. again, not a problem for me because i'm not using these while commuting. and i don't think these are sweatproof, waterproof, foldable, etc., but then again they're not made to be used on public transit 💀 the context of use matters. they're meant for the studio and yeah, since we're all holed up in our houses anyway, they're great for use inside the house too, granted all you do is just listen to music and chill.the sound quality is not remarkable or anything, but it's good enough! you won't find me raving about these for ""how amazing they sound"", but they do sound very good, especially for the price. no complaints with the sound quality esp. given the price.although, a comparable alternative would be the oneodio headphones that a lot of reviewers really like and i did also consider them, but (personally) their design was too tacky and too close to an on-ear pair which only means one thing for people with big ears: pain. but yeah, none of that ""extra bass"" bs that i absolutely detest. the music sounds clear and balanced.caveat: i keep reaching for the wire to change the song constantly forgetting that this doesn't have button controls (or even a mic, but hey, can't complain too much) 😭 if you're someone who does want these extra features, check out the oneodio pair for sure.also, the noise cancellation on these is... not good, period. like ""i could hear my fan through these when i wasn't playing anything"" not good. it's not terrible, but it's just not there, really.and okay, i know there's a whole conversation about studio/monitor headphones not being compatible with regular smartphones involving a lot of technical jargon (""impedance"", ""impedance matching"", etc.), but i don't think you'd have to worry about that stuffl with these. i use these with my redmi note 10 pro to listen to spotify, google podcasts, local music and also to watch videos/movies on youtube, netflix, prime video and i haven't encountered any issues! i believe they'd work just fine with any modern smartphone.in all, these are a great pair and i would say i'm satisfied with my purchase!read more;

hello guys, the most important thing that every future buyer should know is that only a few guys get this product in good condition. most of the buyers face problems like sound imbalance, no sound on one side, damaged products, cables not working well etc. check your headphones in every possible way so that you do not face any problems. other factors like weight, mic quality, appearance, service, and sound quality are good. but the durability of this product is very bad. it is almost fully made of plastic. so if you want to use headphones in conditions where they can be damaged easily, don't buy this one. the major problem i faced using these headphones is the quality of the aux cables is very bad(but if you get them in good condition, sound latency gets really low). it is average in terms of gaming. if you're only buying headphones for gaming, you can instead buy any wired headphones. you can buy this headphone for games like minecraft. for music, this headphone is fantastic. no choice other than this at this price range.thank you for reading. just wanna tell you about this cool headphone.read more;

i'm writing this review to save you the sound-shattering disappointment i experienced with the noise two wirless. these headphones promised audio bliss, but delivered a symphony of frustration.let's start with the build quality. imagine a fragile butterfly crafted from recycled plastic – that's about as sturdy as these headphones felt. they weren't subjected to any mosh pits or extreme sports, just the gentle jostle of daily life. yet, one fateful morning, a sickening crack echoed through my ears as the headband snapped like a stale cracker.now, i'm a reasonable person. accidents happen. so, i contacted noise support, warranty in hand, expecting a swift resolution. what i got was a masterclass in customer service limbo. they dragged their feet through emails, requested photos from every angle (including a panoramic shot of my eardrums, apparently), and ultimately declared the damage ""not covered"" under some obscure clause about ""improper use"" (which, in their interpretation, apparently included breathing).so, here i am, stuck with a broken pair of headphones and a bitter taste in my mouth. the audio, while it lasted, was decent, but not worth the hassle and heartbreak. my advice? steer clear of this brand and its flimsy promises. unless you enjoy the thrill of an audiophile rollercoaster that ends in a crash landing of disappointment, that is.for those seeking a more constructive alternative:do your research! read reviews from multiple sources before diving headfirst into any headphones.prioritize build quality. look for materials known for their durability, not just their sleekness.understand the warranty terms thoroughly. don't get blindsided by hidden clauses or exclusions.remember, your ears deserve better than a sonic heartbreak. choose wisely, and may your listening experience be filled with joy, not cracks and customer service nightmares.read more;

i recently purchased these headphones and unfortunately, they fell short of my expectations in multiple ways. the sound quality is notably low, lacking the depth and bass effect i usually look for in headphones. whether it's the richness of music or the punch of a movie soundtrack, these headphones don't deliver.additionally, the price tag attached to these headphones seems unjustifiable given their performance. the sound is underwhelming, and when considering the competition within the same price range, these headphones fail to stand out.another downside is the short cable for charging, which adds to the inconvenience. having to search for the charging slot every time becomes a frustrating routine. it's a minor issue that adds up to the overall disappointment.ultimately, i can't recommend these headphones due to their lackluster sound, absence of bass effects, and the hassle they create with their short charging cable and inconvenient charging slot placement. at their current price point, these headphones simply aren't worth the investment.read more;

earphones are more comfortable for long use where as over the ear kind compresses the skull.; 3.5/5i have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. i got it for a nice deal (approx. rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). i was reviewing multiple headphones under the rs. 5k range. my first choice was the sony ch-520, but i did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and i didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under rs. 5k). the other options were boat, zebronics (a different set), hammer and a variety of other ones.among them i did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. i wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. it was available at a reasonable price and the rgb lights impressed me. so i ordered them.pros:- sounds good! i'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. no issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. the bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- sturdy. the headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. while laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. i have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. they are still in good shape- rgb. the lights are definitely funky. they look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- battery. applaudable battery without hesitation. i use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.cons:- mic. i've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. my peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what i just said- huge cushions and ear muffs! the size of the muffs are simply too big. when traveling with the headphones on in buses, i like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. but this is simply not possibly with these headphones. the muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. when i try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. so i'm forced to sit rigid for a while- terrible button placement. the power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. this makes it very hard to use the controls. i have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. it's so ridiculous that i stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- bad usb-c connection slot. the usb-c connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other usb-c wires because it has a narrow deep opening. so my phone's usb-c charger doesn't fit in it. only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. this means i always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackoverall decent pair. in my previous (edited now) review, i mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. after several days i realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. so, i have edited my review and updated the ratingcheers!read more; 3.5/5i have been using these headphones for over 2 months

head is supported on the bus seat. but this is simply not possibly with these headphones. the muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. when i try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. so i'm forced to sit rigid for a while- terrible button placement. the power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. this makes it very hard to use the controls. i have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. it's so ridiculous that i stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- bad usb-c connection slot. the usb-c connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other usb-c wires because it has a narrow deep opening. so my phone's usb-c charger doesn't fit in it. only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. this means i always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackoverall decent pair. in my previous (edited now) review, i mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. after several days i realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. so, i have edited my review and updated the ratingcheers!; وصلتني الكرتون مفتوح وقماش

are the best headphones from sony. previously i used sony headphones but they're entry-level headphones.  i also used headphones from other brands like sennheiser, one audio and jbl but all of them are entry-level headphones. this is the first time i bought high-end headphones and i trust sony. you can't go wrong with sony as per my experience. coming to the headphones, i already knew that these were best. however, i researched thoroughly on youtube and read many articles for almost 3 months before buying these. i want to get the best value for the price. these headphones are costly and i don't want to go wrong with my purchase decision.build quality: these are made of high-quality plastic and feel lightweight and comfortable to wear for longer durations. the only thing is, that the headband is thin and hurts a little on my head after wearing it for a few hours. just move or adjust it a little and i'm good to go for another hour.sound quality: it's sony, no need to brag about sound quality. sony is known for sound clarity. every small musical instrument is heard in great detail. i can't forget my first experience of listening to music using these headphones. i'm blown away by the details and the clarity of sound.battery life: it is mentioned 30 hours. seems to be true. headphones will easily last up to two days of mixed usage.noise cancellation (n.c.): these headphones are my first experience with noise cancellation. when nc is turned on, it is silent. zero noise. but after a few days,  i realised that i could still hear voices from other people when they were shouting or talking loudly. it's good not to completely block all sound.update on n.c.:i want to address one thing people who are saying that nc is not good. i think they feel like that because of the adaptive nc feature in the sony headphones app. due to this feature, the level of noise cancelling is adjusted automatically according to the surroundings. i know it doesn't work 100% accurately every time. it works sort of 70 - 80 % accurately depending on the surroundings. that's why some people complain that nc is not completely silent or perfect. some are complaining there is no option to disable the adaptive nc feature. it is available in the sony headphones app after the latest update. we can also manually disable the adaptive nc of headphones using the app. i mentioned these details because some people may not be aware of these features available in the headphones app.note: when nc is turned on, a sound pressure is created between ears and headphones. so there is a vacuum-like seal between ears and headphones and it blocks external sound. i'm not sure how nc works. this is the first time for me experienced noise cancellation. it was a shock and a surprise feeling when nc was on. my brother got scared due to this effect. i got used to it now. check the sony manual regarding the safety of nc. in the sony headphones connect app, there is a safe listening setting. please follow it and you don't need to worry about your ears getting damaged due to headphones. i have attached screenshots of the same. please check.final verdict: i can say that these headphones are the

always of the belief that they have the best music reproduction with lossless audio from apps like apple music. was seriously wanting to try the xms when the xm4 was launched but wasn’t happy with the reviews of mic quality as i generally take calls for more than 7 hours on my work days. but when xm5s came in was tempted to try them after the reviews paying more details on the improved mic quality. i wanted to give it a try and tried the music when i was in france in a store, but the sound quality was very poor since the store let me use it only with their wired audio source and said no to try with my phone. back in india i tried again once in a store using my phone and apple music and boy o boy i was proved wrong!!! i was simply blown over on how the headphones were clear with the spatial audio even with the default eq setting. i’m not a bass heavy person but rather love the different tones and this is a pro quality one in that. with the anc microphones it was even a blessing that the call trials(both with ms teams and phone) i did were fantastic. decided to grab this and ordered in amazon when it was available for around 28k net with cashback and i would say this is the best investment i had made. the dual connectivity, monstrous battery back up, anc combined with the best mic makes it a great headphone one can ever have. the size and case as most say as negative isn’t a

it is disappointing.build and design: i had used these headphones for more than week and i would say device is very comfortable for longer use ( watching movies) , quite light weight , controls are easy to use, touch response is fast with almost no delay.audio: well i am not used to over the ears devices so i cant compare to others but its great overall. bit bassy for my liking and little less bright u can say but it can be easily fixed by eq. so no problems there ( may be brand had tuned it for more neutral profile) .after eq tuning these are mostly excellent for songs , movies podcast etc.also audio quality depends upon you device too. as i tested it on low end mobile and high end devices, u can observe difference.noise cancellation:  i bought these for work at home , typically coding, study research papers , as people can get really vocal and for analysing complex articles you need silence. as per all reviews these are one of the best but you need to keep your expectation realistic. you can easily hear person talking at moderate volume in same room( reduce by a bit ) or even to next room if someone it talking loud or moderately loud.but if in next room people are talking a moderately low volume you wont hear them same is for tv, at high volume you will definitly hear it.( you can play some white noise or music than you minimise other noise.)what more to consider: these cut other background noise like of ac ( almost completely ) , birds, other typical noises. it can get little uncomfortable( unnatural silence 😂) for some in begining. you also hear people because it cut other backgroud noise so much that even little things are more highlighted.for other: if you are buying these for listening music and watching movies while travel it will cut every thing while playing music or movies. maybe these are designed for this purpose.pass though mode: as per my opinion its great , almost natural with no delay,battery i didnt tested extensively that how much time it can go but i feel more than sufficient  easily last for  couple of days  if using 5-6 hours a day, charging is also fast so no worries there.biggest bummer for me. its no surprise that there is no dolby atmos support. i think for this price it should be there, as sony 360 audio is not supported at all platforms n very less content is available. so for spatial audio doby should had been there. i had used other product with dolby it makes huge impact.read more; 4 star rating just for bad packing from seller as there are no packing material on the box. seller

within reach of your budget or a bit of a stretch more, you would not regret the purchase afterwards. still have not gone through all the features, functions, and app but based just based off the sound alone i am extremely satisfied; sony wh-1000xm5 wireless industry leading noise cancelling headphones with auto noise cancelling optimizer, crystal clear hands-free calling, and alexa voice control, blackwell i finally felt time to upgrade my headphones. i've been using the old boss quiet comfort 3's.  quite dated i know. but it lasted me a very long time.  it's done well for menow after much time passed i finally picked up this sony xm5.my comparison is with that old headphone.  perhaps not the best apples to apples fairness.  i don't look for studio reference flat sound with these . i look daily music listening whilst working. something to work out with.  something that has good enough clarity in highs and deep bass for pop music.  my high fi lilistening is done by wired headphones which is a total other category of audiophile gear.for these i need superb noise cancelling that is superior to bose .  i need exciting lively bass tightness and crispy highs without harshness.  a good mic for conference calls.  an ambient mode to use when jogging.this sony xm5 delivers and tldr i can easily replace my bose qm3 with these.1. sound .  first thing i noticed immediately... this has ultra tight bass .  bass is as deep as you want it. and can be set to create a super tight quick reacting bass.  very satisfying in all musical genres.  wayyy exceeds bose bass performance which imo was its weakest point .  by default thigh highs are flat and lifeless but after a super quick eqing session i got it to my preferred listening and it sounds amazing.  i'm very happy with the sound. it feels smooth and unfatiguing when i want it... and then it can be eq'd to be clinically sharp but not harsh.... whenever you feel like it.  it is hands down a huge step above bose.2. noise cancelling.  tldr?  huge upgrade over bose qc3.  it's dead quiet.  it is scare silent actually... really eerie.  i love this because i turn it on and just use it as a way to work i'm office without the hum of the hvac system.3. ambient mode.  the sony app allows you to adjust the levels to satisfy how much exterior sound to leak into your headphones. i like this.  it also allows you to setup detection mode to allow you to swap to ambient mode automatically when you talk and have conversations.... music stops.  after 15 seconds the ambient mode reverts back to noise reduction mode and resumes music.  really handy.  love it.3. mic for conference calls.  absolutely outstanding without premature cutting off of voice which is a common issue with these headphone mics... bose suffered from this greatly.  this is crystal clear mic and no issues using this in professional conference calls.4.  tap controls.. very simple straight forward. uses a swipe or tap setup on the right ear.  the entire right side ear flat side is a drawing board .  large surface area makes for superbly reliable gestures that make it consistent and easy to control.  swiping up and down is volume.  swiping fwd or back is tracks.  double tapping pause and resumes.  theres no way to adjust the gesture actions on the app. .nor is there a way to make the left side become gesture side in case you prefer left side .... it's only right side.  to me it is not a show stopper but perhaps for others it could be. the only other buttons is the anc button to toggle noise cancelling mode and ambient mode.  you can program double or triple clicking of the button to launch spotify or other music apps but i only use double tap for spotify.  the other button is on/off / pairing.  this isn't customizable.  i would have liked to see a bit more customizable actions here but it's ok... sometimes it's better to have more simplicity.  oh by the way you can turn off the tap swipe gestures

found it in amazon warehouse open box pricing.  you can't beat that .hope this helpsread more; sony wh-1000xm5 wireless industry leading noise cancelling headphones with auto noise cancelling optimizer, crystal clear hands-free calling, and alexa voice control, blackwell i finally felt time to upgrade my headphones. i've been using the old boss quiet comfort 3's.  quite dated i know. but it lasted me a very long time.  it's done well for menow after much time passed i finally picked up this sony xm5.my comparison is with that old headphone.  perhaps not the best apples to apples fairness.  i don't look for studio reference flat sound with these . i look daily music listening whilst working. something to work out with.  something that has good enough clarity in highs and deep bass for pop music.  my high fi lilistening is done by wired headphones which is a total other category of audiophile gear.for these i need superb noise cancelling that is superior to bose .  i need exciting lively bass tightness and crispy highs without harshness.  a good mic for conference calls.  an ambient mode to use when jogging.this sony xm5 delivers and tldr i can easily replace my bose qm3 with these.1. sound .  first thing i noticed immediately... this has ultra tight bass .  bass is as deep as you want it. and can be set to create a super tight quick reacting bass.  very satisfying in all musical genres.  wayyy exceeds bose bass performance which imo was its weakest point .  by default thigh highs are flat and lifeless but after a super quick eqing session i got it to my preferred listening and it sounds amazing.  i'm very happy with the sound. it feels smooth and unfatiguing when i want it... and then it can be eq'd to be clinically sharp but not harsh.... whenever you feel like it.  it is hands down a huge step above bose.2. noise cancelling.  tldr?  huge upgrade over bose qc3.  it's dead quiet.  it is scare silent actually... really eerie.  i love this because i turn it on and just use it as a way to work i'm office without the hum of the hvac system.3. ambient mode.  the sony app allows you to adjust the levels to satisfy how much exterior sound to leak into your headphones. i like this.  it also allows you to setup detection mode to allow you to swap to ambient mode automatically when you talk and have conversations.... music stops.  after 15 seconds the ambient mode reverts back to noise reduction mode and resumes music.  really handy.  love it.3. mic for conference calls.  absolutely outstanding without premature cutting off of voice which is a common issue with these headphone mics... bose suffered from this greatly.  this is crystal clear mic and no issues using this in professional conference calls.4.  tap controls.. very simple straight forward. uses a swipe or tap setup on the right ear.  the entire right side ear flat side is a drawing board .  large surface area makes for superbly reliable gestures that make it consistent and easy to control.  swiping up and down is volume.  swiping fwd or back is tracks.  double tapping pause and resumes.  theres no way to adjust the gesture actions on the app. .nor is there a way to make the left side become gesture side in case you prefer left side .... it's only right side.  to me it is not a show stopper but perhaps for others it could be. the only other buttons is the anc button to toggle noise cancelling mode and ambient mode.  you can program double or triple clicking of the button to launch spotify or other music apps but i only use double tap for spotify.  the other button is on/off / pairing.  this isn't customizable.  i would have liked to see a bit more customizable actions here but it's ok... sometimes it's better to have more simplicity.  oh by the way you can turn off the tap swipe gestures entirely  case you find this to be annoying with accidental taps especially when you're wearing the headphones laying down5. automatic modes.

major, very big problem which is kinda aceeptable for someone and not for a lot of pepole. the problem is sound leakage, if you listen even above 50% vol or for some songs even at 30% vol, the sound starts to get outside earphone. your experience won't get bad for urself but the outsiders could also hear it which is why its not good to use it in public. if u go on 90% volume, rather than a headphone it becomes a speaker, u won't face any problem in ears, but voice outside will come loud easily hearable. it means brand gave everything, but could not block the speakers towards the outer

earphones are more comfortable for long use where as over the ear kind compresses the skull.; 3.5/5i have been using these headphones for over 2 months now. i got it for a nice deal (approx. rs. 1300) while it was available for much lesser a while ago (some comments claimed it). i was reviewing multiple headphones under the rs. 5k range. my first choice was the sony ch-520, but i did not opt for it because this is my first over-the-ear-headphone pair and i didn't want to go with a reasonably pricey one (even though it was under rs. 5k). the other options were boat, zebronics (a different set), hammer and a variety of other ones.among them i did not choose the least expensive one nor the costliest one. i wanted to give this pair a try at its price point. it was available at a reasonable price and the rgb lights impressed me. so i ordered them.pros:- sounds good! i'm no expert in acoustics, but the experience with these headphones in terms of sound quality was definitely good. no issues while traveling in a bus or auto with the headphones on. the bass/treble are good and neither are over-boosted- sturdy. the headphones are bulky and they can hold some pressure. while laying down or inside a backpack, they do not give up too quickly. i have slept with my backpack as a pillow with the headphones inside multiple times. they are still in good shape- rgb. the lights are definitely funky. they look cool, especially if you are a gamer/streamer- battery. applaudable battery without hesitation. i use them for 2-4 hours or more on an average day, and it lasts easily for multiple days one a single charge.cons:- mic. i've not used this set for a ton of phone calls. my peers simply called out the poor quality of the mic and kept asking me to repeat what i just said- huge cushions and ear muffs! the size of the muffs are simply too big. when traveling with the headphones on in buses, i like to relax and lay back such that my head is supported on the bus seat. but this is simply not possibly with these headphones. the muffs come in the way and don't let me fully rest. when i try to wiggle to the left or right, the muffs hit the seat and obstruct my neck movement. so i'm forced to sit rigid for a while- terrible button placement. the power on/off, volume buttons are placed on the bottom left side with the buttons facing in the direction of eyesight. this makes it very hard to use the controls. i have to search with my thumb, then my pointing finger; and even after that using the volume up/down or power buttons is a pain. it's so ridiculous that i stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- bad usb-c connection slot. the usb-c connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other usb-c wires because it has a narrow deep opening. so my phone's usb-c charger doesn't fit in it. only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. this means i always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackoverall decent pair. in my previous (edited now) review, i mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. after several days i realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. so, i have edited my review and updated the ratingcheers!read more; 3.5/5i have been using these headphones for over 2 months

is a pain. it's so ridiculous that i stopped using the volume buttons on the headphones and started using the controls from the device it is connected to.- bad usb-c connection slot. the usb-c connection slot is poorly designed in the sense that it does not accept other usb-c wires because it has a narrow deep opening. so my phone's usb-c charger doesn't fit in it. only the wire that comes along with the headphone in the box fits into it. this means i always have to carry an additional wire in my backpackoverall decent pair. in my previous (edited now) review, i mentioned that the muffs caused ear pain. after several days i realized it was not the headphones that caused the pain, but my glasses. so, i have edited my review and updated the ratingcheers!; وصلتني الكرتون مفتوح وقماش
